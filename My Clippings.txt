Simply put, the Law of Attraction says that you will attract into your life whatever you focus on. Whatever you give your energy and attention to will come back to you. So, if you stay focused on the good and positive things in your life, you will automatically attract more good and positive things into your life. If you are focused upon lack and negativity, then that is what will be attracted into your life.

We have a tendency to focus on what we don’t want in so many areas of our lives, even when it comes to our own health. Think of how often when faced with an illness or disease we become completely preoccupied with the problem and not the desired outcome. We tend to give our focus entirely to the illness, and all that it entails, instead of focusing on being healthy. Since what you focus on expands, you want to direct your energy and thoughts to those of being well. Keep your thoughts positive and optimistic, and see yourself as healthy and whole. Your positive energy, thoughts, visualizations, affirmations, prayer, and meditation combined with whatever medical treatment you choose to seek will serve to enhance the healing process. Remember, in every aspect of your life keep your focus as much as possible on what it is that you do want and not on that which you don’t want.

Unfortunately, most of us have given very little time or thought to these questions. We’ve gotten so caught up in the hustle and bustle of our daily routines that we just haven’t taken the time. We’re pretty good at itemizing the things that haven’t been going so well and the things we have to complain about. So, we’re pretty clear about what we don’t want, but we haven’t given much consideration to what we do want. In order to attract what you want in your life, you must first take the time to clearly identify your dreams and desires.

How to use your affirmations: 1. Repeat your affirmations at least three times a day. The best times are first thing in the morning, the middle of the day, and around bedtime. 2. Work in depth with a few affirmations. This is much more effective than working less frequently with a greater number of them. 3. Say your affirmations out loud, if possible. If not, read them silently to yourself. 4. Close your eyes and visualize yourself as the affirmation describes. See the scene through your eyes, as if it were happening around you, just the way you would be seeing it in real life. 5. Hear the sounds; see the images that would be present when you successfully achieve what your affirmation describes. Include any other people who would be there, and hear their words of encouragement and congratulations. 6. Feel the emotions that you would experience when you achieve this goal. The stronger your feelings are, the more powerful the impact.

Create your day with this simple visualization. Sit in a comfortable upright position, close your eyes, and bring your hands together, fingertips touching in your lap, with your spine nice and straight. Now take several slow, deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Concentrate on the rise and fall of your stomach and chest with each breath and, with each breath, find yourself becoming more and more relaxed. Now, just let your breathing find its own natural rhythm—slow, steady, and relaxed. Imagine a radiant white light slowly coming up the left side of your body—starting at your left foot and gradually coming up through your left leg, the left side of your torso,  <You have reached the clipping limit for this item>

It’s for this reason that Beta men are reluctant to experiment with being more dominant; they carry over from their single-hood the same mistaken belief that women require comfort, familiarity and security in order to become intimate or “feel sexy”. They still fail to grasp, even in marriage, that sex by definition requires anxiety to be grounded in genuine desire. Sexual tension requires urgency, learn how to stoke it in your woman.

Most important though is to do this covertly. If you go popping off about how you’re taking your balls back and she’d better shape up or you’ll be looking for a woman who is into fucking you – you’ll just come off as inauthentic. You have to imply with your attitude and behavior that something has changed in you.

Solipsism is the evolved, selected-for result of self-preservation necessities that ensured the survival of our species. As men we get frustrated by this intrinsic nature; a nature that puts women’s imperatives as their primary mental point of origin. As any newly aware Red Pill man will attest, coming to this realization is a very hard truth to accept.

The notion that women are mothers and nurturers was predictably spelled out, but with regards to empathizing and caring for men, the primary concern of women was worry over their own and their children’s well being before that of their men should they become injured, incapacitated or killed.

One of the most eye opening of the solipsistic world of females was when a plate of mine was giving me directions on where to pick her up. It went something like this: Her: “When you come to that traffic light, turn over to me.” Me: “What do you mean?” Her: “Just turn here towards me.” Me: “How the hell am I supposed to know which way is that?

Fourteen per cent of the people who drink gin consume 80 per cent of all the gin. In everything you do, keep your eye glued to the heavy users. They are unlike occasional users in their motivations.

A.S.C. Ehrenberg of the London Business School has established that consumers do not buy one brand of soap, or coffee, or detergent. They have a repertory of four or five brands, and move from one to another. They almost never buy a brand which has not been admitted to their repertory during its first year on the market.

Always hold your sales meetings in rooms too small for the audience, even if it means holding them in the WC. ‘Standing room only’ creates an atmosphere of success, as in theatres and restaurants, while a half-empty auditorium smells of failure.

In a social order that reinforces the entitlements presumed by women’s solipsism there develops an internal conflict between the need for an optimized Hypergamy and the ego-investments a woman’s solipsism demands to preserve it. As a woman progresses towards the Wall and a lessened capacity to optimize both sides (Alpha Fucks and Beta Bucks) of Hypergamy this conflict comes to a head.

Women cannot bear to see a Man experiencing negative emotions such as extreme anger, rage, fear, despair, despondency or depression for extended periods of time. You say you want to “be there” for your Man; but you cannot do it. If it goes on long enough, it kills the attraction; it sets off your hypergamy alarms; and subconsciously causes you to start hunting for a replacement Man. A woman seeing a Male go through the above will seek to replace that Male immediately.

That all makes for good fiction, but it hardly squares against the “oh, men are such big babies when it comes to pain” trope, or does it? If women are granted the authority to define what really hurts and what doesn’t for men – due to a socially presumed ownership of empathy – then this puts them into a better control of which men can best qualify for feminine Hypergamy. In other words, women own the selective-breeding game if they can convince men that they know, by literal experience, what really hurts a man and what doesn’t, or what shouldn’t.

Changes in the male features that evoke sexual interest: Since the late 1990s, some researchers have argued that what changes most notably across the cycle is not sexual desire per se but, rather, the extent to which women’s sexual interests are evoked by particular male features – specifically, male behavioral and physical features associated with dominance, assertiveness, and developmental robustness.

The importance of behavioral features? Whereas preference shifts of major interest early on concerned male physical features (e.g., facial masculinity; scent), several recent studies have focused on women’s reactions to men’s behavior and dispositions. Previous research had found that women find male confidence, even a degree of arrogance, more sexually appealing during the fertile phase. Recent studies replicate and extend that work, finding not only that fertile-phase women are more sexually attracted to “sexy cad” or behaviorally masculine men (relative to “good dad” or less masculine men), but also that, during the fertile phase, women are more likely to flirt or engage with such men. Females of a variety of species, including primates, prefer dominant or high ranking males during the fertile phase of their cycles. These males may pass genetic benefits to offspring, as well as, potentially, offer material benefits (e.g., protect offspring). Women’s fertile-phase sexual attraction to behavioral dominance appears to have deep evolutionary roots.

Within the dual sexuality framework (Alpha genetic and Beta provisional imperatives), fertile-phase sexuality and non-fertile-phase sexuality possess potentially overlapping but also distinct functions. In a number of primate species, extended sexuality – female receptivity and proceptivity at times other than the fertile phase – appears to function to confuse paternity by allowing non-dominant males sexual access. These males cannot rule out their own paternity, which might reduce their likelihood of harming a female’s offspring. In humans, by contrast, extended sexuality may function to induce primary pair-bond partners to invest in women and offspring.

In 1975, a pioneering study documented increased attractiveness of women’s vaginal odors midcycle. A quarter century later, research revealing other detectable fertile-phase changes began to accumulate, including increased attractiveness of women’s upper torso odors, increased vocal pitch and attractiveness, and changes in women’s style of dress and solicitous behaviors. Meta-analysis of this literature confirms that changes across the cycle in women’s attractiveness are often subtle, but robust).

During the fertile window, women report increased jealous behavior by male partners. A possible mediator of such changes – testosterone – is higher in men after they smell t-shirts collected from women on high- than on low-fertility days of the cycle. A recent study examined related phenomena in established relationships by bringing couples into the lab for a close interaction task (e.g., slow dancing). Following the interaction, male partners viewed images of men who were attractive and described as competitive or unattractive and noncompetitive. Only men in the competitive condition showed increases in testosterone from baseline – and only when tested during their partner’s fertile phase.

Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during difficult times. Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it. At one point, Frankl writes that a person “may remain brave, dignified and unselfish, or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal.” He concedes that only a few prisoners of the Nazis were able to do the former, “but even one such example is sufficient proof that man’s inner strength may raise him above his outward fate.” Finally, Frankl’s most enduring insight, one that I have called on often in my own life and in countless counseling situations: Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.

Again and again I therefore admonish my students both in Europe and in America: “Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run—in the long run, I say!—success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.”

To discover that there was any semblance of art in a concentration camp must be surprise enough for an outsider, but he may be even more astonished to hear that one could find a sense of humor there as well; of course, only the faint trace of one, and then only for a few seconds or minutes. Humor was another of the soul’s weapons in the fight for self-preservation. It is well known that humor, more than anything else in the human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds. I practically trained a friend of mine who worked next to me on the building site to develop a sense of humor. I suggested to him that we would promise each other to invent at least one amusing story daily, about some incident that could happen one day after our liberation. He was a surgeon and had been an assistant on the staff of a large hospital. So I once tried to get him to smile by describing to him how he would be unable to lose the habits of camp life when he returned to his former work. On the building site (especially when the supervisor made his tour of inspection) the foreman encouraged us to work faster by shouting: “Action!

Suddenly an orderly will rush in announcing the arrival of the senior surgeon by shouting, ‘Action! Action!’”

To discover that there was any semblance of art in a concentration camp must be surprise enough for an outsider, but he may be even more astonished to hear that one could find a sense of humor there as well; of course, only the faint trace of one, and then only for a few seconds or minutes. Humor was another of the soul’s weapons in the fight for self-preservation. It is well known that humor, more than anything else in the human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds. I practically trained a friend of mine who worked next to me on the building site to develop a sense of humor. I suggested to him that we would promise each other to invent at least one amusing story daily, about some incident that could happen one day after our liberation. He was a surgeon and had been an assistant on the staff of a large hospital. So I once tried to get him to smile by describing to him how he would be unable to lose the habits of camp life when he returned to his former work. On the building site (especially when the supervisor made his tour of inspection) the foreman encouraged us to work faster by shouting: “Action! Action!” I told my friend, “One day you will be back in the operating room, performing a big abdominal operation. Suddenly an orderly will rush in announcing the arrival of the senior surgeon by shouting, ‘Action! Action!’” Sometimes the other men invented amusing dreams about the future, such as forecasting that during a future dinner engagement they might forget themselves when the soup was served and beg the hostess to ladle it “from the bottom.” The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living. Yet it is possible to practice the art of living even in a concentration camp, although suffering is omnipresent. To draw an analogy: a man’s suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the “size” of human suffering is absolutely relative.

In attempting this psychological presentation and a psychopathological explanation of the typical characteristics of a concentration camp inmate, I may give the impression that the human being is completely and unavoidably influenced by his surroundings. (In this case the surroundings being the unique structure of camp life, which forced the prisoner to conform his conduct to a certain set pattern.) But what about human liberty? Is there no spiritual freedom in regard to behavior and reaction to any given surroundings? Is that theory true which would have us believe that man is no more than a product of many conditional and environmental factors—be they of a biological, psychological or sociological nature? Is man but an accidental product of these? Most important, do the prisoners’ reactions to the singular world of the concentration camp prove that man cannot escape the influences of his surroundings? Does man have no choice of action in the face of such circumstances? We can answer these questions from experience as well as on principle. The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action. There were enough examples, often of a heroic nature, which proved that apathy could be overcome, irritability suppressed. Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress. We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way. And there were always choices to make. Every day, every hour, offered the opportunity to make a decision, a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determined whether or not you would become the plaything of circumstance, renouncing freedom and dignity to become molded into the form of the typical inmate. Seen from this point of view, the mental reactions of the inmates of a concentration camp must seem more to us than the mere expression of certain physical and sociological conditions. Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insuffcient food and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone. Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him—mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp. Dostoevski said once, “There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.” These words frequently came to my mind after I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whose suffering and death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost. It can be said that they were worthy of their sufferings; the way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement. It is this spiritual freedom—which cannot be taken away—that makes life meaningful and purposeful. An active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize values in creative work, while a passive life of enjoyment affords him the opportunity to obtain fulfillment in experiencing beauty, art, or nature. But there is also purpose in that life which is almost barren of both creation and enjoyment and which admits of but one possibility of high moral behavior: namely, in man’s attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces. A creative life and a life of enjoyment are banned to him. But not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.

What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. These tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differ from man to man, and from moment to moment. Thus it is impossible to define the meaning of life in a general way. Questions about the meaning of life can never be answered by sweeping statements. “Life” does not mean something vague, but something very real and concrete, just as life’s tasks are also very real and concrete. They form man’s destiny, which is different and unique for each individual. No man and no destiny can be compared with any other man or any other destiny. No situation repeats itself, and each situation calls for a different response. Sometimes the situation in which a man finds himself may require him to shape his own fate by action. At other times it is more advantageous for him to make use of an opportunity for contemplation and to realize assets in this way. Sometimes man may be required simply to accept fate, to bear his cross. Every situation is distinguished by its uniqueness, and there is always only one right answer to the problem posed by the situation at hand. When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden.

Once the meaning of suffering had been revealed to us, we refused to minimize or alleviate the camp’s tortures by ignoring them or harboring false illusions and entertaining artificial optimism. Suffering had become a task on which we did not want to turn our backs. We had realized its hidden opportunities for achievement, the opportunities which caused the poet Rilke to write, “Wie viel ist aufzuleiden!” (How much suffering there is to get through!). Rilke spoke of “getting through suffering” as others would talk of “getting through work.”

I remember two cases of would-be suicide, which bore a striking similarity to each other. Both men had talked of their intentions to commit suicide. Both used the typical argument —they had nothing more to expect from life. In both cases it was a question of getting them to realize that life was still expecting something from them; something in the future was expected of them.

This uniqueness and singleness which distinguishes each individual and gives a meaning to his existence has a bearing on creative work as much as it does on human love. When the impossibility of replacing a person is realized, it allows the responsibility which a man has for his existence and its continuance to appear in all its magnitude. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the “why” for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any “how.”

But I did not only talk of the future and the veil which was drawn over it. I also mentioned the past; all its joys, and how its light shone even in the present darkness. Again I quoted a poet—to avoid sounding like a preacher myself—who had written, “Was Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben.” (What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.) Not only our experiences, but all we have done, whatever great thoughts we may have had, and all we have suffered, all this is not lost, though it is past; we have brought it into being. Having been is also a kind of being, and perhaps the surest kind.

Thus it can be seen that mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become. Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. We should not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a potential meaning for him to fulfill. It is only thus that we evoke his will to meaning from its state of latency. I consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibrium or, as it is called in biology, “homeostasis,” i.e., a tensionless state. What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him. What man needs is not homeostasis but what I call “noö-dynamics,” i.e., the existential dynamics in a polar field of tension where one pole is represented by a meaning that is to be fulfilled and the other pole by the man who has to fulfill it. And one should not think that this holds true only for normal conditions; in neurotic individuals, it is even more valid. If architects want to strengthen a decrepit arch, they increase the load which is laid upon it, for thereby the parts are joined more firmly together. So if therapists wish to foster their patients’ mental health, they should not be afraid to create a sound amount of tension through a reorientation toward the meaning of one’s life. Having shown the beneficial impact of meaning orientation, I turn to the detrimental influence of that feeling of which so many patients complain today, namely, the feeling of the total and ultimate meaninglessness of their lives. They lack the awareness of a meaning worth living for. They are haunted by the experience of their inner emptiness, a void within themselves; they are caught in that situation which I have called the “existential vacuum.”

Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence.

This emphasis on responsibleness is reflected in the categorical imperative of logotherapy, which is: “Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!” It seems to me that there is nothing which would stimulate a man’s sense of responsibleness more than this maxim, which invites him to imagine first that the present is past and, second, that the past may yet be changed and amended. Such a precept confronts him with life’s finiteness as well as the finality of what he makes out of both his life and himself.

Thus far we have shown that the meaning of life always changes, but that it never ceases to be. According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering. The first, the way of achievement or accomplishment, is quite obvious. The second and third need further elaboration. The second way of finding a meaning in life is by experiencing something—such as goodness, truth and beauty—by experiencing nature and culture or, last but not least, by experiencing another human being in his very uniqueness—by loving him.

Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.

And in another paper she expressed the hope that logotherapy “may help counteract certain unhealthy trends in the present-day culture of the United States, where the incurable sufferer is given very little opportunity to be proud of his suffering and to consider it ennobling rather than degrading” so that “he is not only unhappy, but also ashamed of being unhappy.”

Logotherapy, keeping in mind the essential transitoriness of human existence, is not pessimistic but rather activistic. To express this point figuratively we might say: The pessimist resembles a man who observes with fear and sadness that his wall calendar, from which he daily tears a sheet, grows thinner with each passing day. On the other hand, the person who attacks the problems of life actively is like a man who removes each successive leaf from his calendar and files it neatly and carefully away with its predecessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities that a young person has, the future which is in store for him? “No, thank you,” he will think. “Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, though these are things which cannot inspire envy.”

To cite the most common illustration, a right-handed player (whose left hand naturally is much less powerful than his right) kills any chance for a cooperative union of both hands if his right hand is dominant from the start or if it can assume dominance in the middle of the swing and take the whole swing over. One essential, then, to insure yourself a firm two-handed grip is to get your left hand on the club absolutely correctly.

In the completed grip, the main pressure points are the last three fingers, with the forefinger and the palm pad adding assisting pressure. The three fingers press up, the pad presses down, and the shaft is locked in between. Keeping pressure on the shaft with the palm pad does three things: it strengthens the left arm throughout the swing; at the top of the backswing, the pressure from this pad prevents the club from slipping from the player’s grasp; and it acts as a firm reinforcement at impact.

Having one’s ego inflated is a heady experience, and if you can provide it on a consistent basis, your prey will eventually see you as the source of all things appealing and wonderful. Your prey will be far more grateful about being praised for his weak points than his strengths. A champion wrestler does not need to be told what a good athlete he is; he will be infinitely more grateful if you tell him he’s smart, or something else he rarely hears. Do make your compliments credible, for otherwise it will seem you’re mocking him.

You can’t really respond positively here without lying through your teeth. In instances where you find it difficult to agree with the sentiment of people’s words, substitute “Yes, AND…” with “Yes, really?”

That’s the final aspect in a nutshell: proactively think about the underlying emotion people want to evoke you, and then give it to them. It sounds like it would be incredibly difficult to do in the spur of the moment, but it’s easier than you think since there are only so few emotions that want back from you. Joy. Anger. Humor.

Another downside to starting off with "No" is that it blocks the addition of new information. You basically state that no additional information is needed or welcome. You’ve already made your own decision, and are not interested in listening to their reasons or details. This not only makes you appear closed-minded, stubborn, and abrasive, but it harms you because you don’t get the full picture of whatever you’re discussing.

It’s not a chapter about only not using the word “No” as much, nor is it about just nodding your head and keeping quiet when people are presenting something that is contrary to your views or interest. It’s a chapter about not being dismissive of people, or shutting them down, because there are both short and long term effects of such habits.  The short term effects are awkwardness, confusion, tension, and disrupting a conversational flow. You are cutting people’s topics short, which makes them confused if you truly meant to do that. When they realize that you did intend to cut them short, there is tension and awkwardness, and then the conversation is disrupted. The long term effects are much worse, however. If you realize that whenever you talk to someone, they continually shut you down or appear to judgmentally refuse the direction you want to speak in, then they will stop opening up to you or bringing anything up to you. They won’t feel comfortable being vulnerable with you because you’ve proven that you only dismiss and reject them.  Nobody really intends to be offended when somebody says the word "No."

Take the role of the salesperson. A well-known sales technique is to continue to ask people escalating questions that inevitably they answer “Yes” to, such as “Would you like to save more money?” They thrive on creating a flow of positivity, and the positivity leads to sales because people imagine what they are missing by not having what is being sold. When you begin a sentence with "No", you are essentially poisoning the well of your prospects as to what's possible, for better or worse.

In the quest for motion and additional elements and angles, there is the danger of planning ahead with fixed ideas and destinations in mind. This is dangerous for a few reasons. First, imagine the concept of an improv comedy performance with three participants, and all three already have fixed ideas of where they want to scene to go. In essence, they will be influencing each other and trying to herd the other two into the directions that they want. It won’t be teamwork, it’s just teammates trying to exert control over each other in front of an audience. It won’t be pretty unless you like hearing three monologues simultaneously. Second, you run the risk of spectacular failure when you are derailed from the path of your fixed destination. This is because you are so fixated on the destination that you haven’t kept an open mind to other subjects or topics, and won’t be able to adapt very well. If you’ve been thinking the whole time about how to turn the conversation or performance to the subjects of cars, you will probably come up tongue tied when the subject instead turns to different types of hats. If you are open to the destination, you can roll with the punches, so to speak, because your mental bandwidth isn’t otherwise consumed. Third, having a fixed destination in mind for your conversation or improv performance makes you too goal-oriented, by definition this means you are willfully ignoring everything else that happens in front of you. You might even be dismissing them because they aren’t what you are looking for.

How do you take your conversations less seriously? It’s a matter of interpretation and reaction. There are two ways to interpret and react to any given statement. “I just went skiing and almost crashed into a tree.” Response #1: “I see. Did you hurt yourself?” “I didn’t, but almost.” This response is serious and plays directly to the facts. It’s nice to be worried about someone, but it’s a conversation direction that leads to a serious discussion. You’re asking about the context and the consequences here, and you will likely ask more about the procedure of the near-crash – again, which is fine, but is a serious way of responding. “I just went skiing and almost crashed into a tree.” Response #2: “I always knew you were an amazing skier.” “Hah, I know. I’ve always been so coordinated.” What’s the difference between these two responses? This one actually sidesteps the discussion about the near-crash and makes a joke about the person’s skiing ability. Some of you might interpret this as a callous and insensitive question, but that’s the reason you’re not more entertaining in conversation. People aren’t telling you about their near-crash for your sympathy, they are telling you because it’s notable and they want to engage on it. You are engaging on it here, but also giving a response that prompts people to open up, joke, and play on the topic.

There is a “chicken and the egg” positive feedback cycle with you being a better man and you getting better sex. All it takes is a little laziness creeping into your relationship and you can hit a patch of not getting enough sex, so you start getting a little moody, so she likes you less, so you get less sex. Suddenly there’s a negative feedback cycle kicking in creating a slow spiraling death towards a sexless marriage; you want more sex and she wants you to be better and neither one of you get what they want. You just lie there in bed next to each other lonely and confused as to how you got there.

The Beta Male Traits are those needed for a modern relationship. These are often about the ability to be socially submissive and in a loose sense a “Nice Guy”. The Beta Male Traits are devoted to things that are good for raising children in the modern age like having a work ethic, building the nest, kindness, parenting skills, listening, holding a job, controlling anger and sexual energy, being artistic, verbal skill and creativity. The positive version is the man who provides for and supports his family; the negative version is the man who gives away all relationship power to the woman and turns himself into her “pussy whipped” servant.

It’s of course extremely inappropriate for a female friend of your wife to say to her “I’d really like to have sex with your husband,” but it’s usually perfectly fine to say to her “I’m so jealous of your husband cooking. I wish my husband cooked.” This of course is often done in the presence of her husband as well and amounts to an enormous Preselection effect. She’s openly announcing her interest in the chef husband and snubbing her own. “Want your man, don’t want my man.”

If you have a two year old having a temper tantrum over getting candy and you give them candy to shut them up, you’re going to get more tantrums to get more candy. Likewise, if your wife frequently declines sex and you pander to her constantly trying to get sex, then you’re establishing that her giving you no sex results in you rewarding her. You are in effect training her to continue to deny you sex in the future.

As a critical point - the more divergent the Sex Rank, the greater the relationship stress. A male 5 with a female 6 relationship may be an "imperfect marriage” but can survive if the couple has a strong moral basis. A male 4 with a female 6 marriage is likely to just fold, or be only tolerable to the wife if she has affairs on the side. A male 3 with a female 6 relationship is doomed, as other men will brazenly approach the wife for a relationship knowing they are far more attractive than the husband.

nice example of orbiting is Taylor Swift's "You Belong With Me.” “But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers Dreaming bout the day when you wake up and find That what you're lookin for has been here the whole time” In the song, the cheerleader girlfriend is a 10 and the focus of the song is the boy who is probably an 8. As he is two ranks below the cheerleader girl, she craps all over him in their relationship. He's crazy about her, but it's just painfully one-sided. The boy is supposedly the cheerleader’s boyfriend, but she treats him as her Orbiter. Taylor's character in the song is a 6 and she’s just crazy about the boy who is an 8. Unfortunately, she has about as much chance with him as he has with the cheerleader. Consequently he craps all over her by not even realizing she could have feelings for him and simply uses her to prop him up to sustain the emotional battering he gets from the cheerleader. Taylor’s character is the Orbiter of the boy. Of course all three of them have no way

The most vital point for a husband to understand is the wedding was not the finishing line. Staying sexually attractive to your wife is a lifelong requirement these days. Sometimes the very reason your wife is rejecting you sexually is that she is less attracted to you and she has simply calibrated her sexual response to you down.

I am of the firm belief that in sexless marriages, the spouse who denies sex is cheating the other out of their marriage agreement. I use the word “cheating” quite purposely and see it as minimally different from an “affair.” The marriage agreement is one of mutual sexual exclusivity and meeting each other’s sexual needs. A spouse who goes outside the relationship for sex denies the cheated on spouse their half of the marriage agreement. A spouse who denies the other reasonable sexual access cheats the other out of their half of the marriage agreement. Either way the marriage is under enormous difficulty.

assume a male 6 is married to a female 7 who is hardly interested in him sexually anymore. Should the husband announce that she could either be cheated on, get divorced, or start having with him sex four times a week, the conversation will likely not go nearly as well as he might imagine and he will not like the result at all. She might just laugh at him and accept the divorce option. You should never issue an ultimatum unless you are the higher Sex Rank of the couple.

However, most times when one spouse cuts the other off sexually, the sex tapers off gradually and there isn’t usually a critical incident. Over time the high sex spouse just takes it with quiet suffering, save for the pleading for sex or requests to visit a doctor to see if anything medical is going on. Then they wait and hope that magically the sex returns and when it doesn't years can pass by. The pain and hurt can mount up for so long that you can build up a tolerance for a level of suffering that no mentally healthy person would consider tolerable.

Medical issues aside, when you are cut off from sex by your spouse, the marriage is in critical condition because one spouse has started actively working against the marriage. This is a serious and legitimate issue. You have the right to feel angry and hurt by it. It’s okay to take action to address this issue.

Your own wife is probably one of the easiest women you know to get a positive response from by running The MAP. After all, she was into you enough to marry you, so there has to be some sort of baseline interest and that should peak if you are the best version of you possible. She’s also heavily invested in your relationship and it’s the path of least resistance to see you blossom into a sexier man. Her other option if she wants a sexier husband is to attempt the very risky strategy of divorcing you and trying to find a new husband that is better than you.

However, the physical symptoms of the Approach Anxiety reaction are exactly the same as that of the “flight or fight” response. As daft as it sounds, when a man approaches a woman in hope of gaining a phone number, what really makes his heart race is adrenaline.

The key to verbal interaction is keeping your banter light-hearted and playful, but also pushing the limits to see what you can get away with as well. You should be trying to playfully instigate her into engaging in further interaction with you.  Light teasing works very well. Don’t be insulting or rude, but lightly tease her. This shows a lack of social fear and high confidence that women find attractive. Look back over your early life at all the times when the naughty boys were a little bit mean to the girls and the girls just lapped it up, making a huge fuss over the boys teasing them. If the girls were all in bikinis sunbathing, you can bet that the guy who sprayed them with a hose got a verbal telling off – but then was the one they all wanted to get with. Remember how girls would squeal at the boy chasing them with a spider? If you ever push it just a little too far, you can always apologize and say, “I’m so sorry I did that, but there is a good explanation why I did that…. I’m an asshole.” Then you give a big naughty boy grin.

The simplest variant is when she suddenly just feels something negative and the man must do something to alter the way she feels to something more positive. “Well I don’t feel like you really care about me, why can’t you bring me flowers once in a while?” On one level, it seems a reasonable request, but the language is one of manipulation.

These are often small tasks that barely require any effort, so you can unwittingly start performing them for her simply trying to be “polite”, or “nice”. But if you’re starting to find yourself being her butler, then you’ve established that she is the dominant one in the relationship and you are Displaying Low Value.

My advice to him was to try the Sexy Move in the shower routine (described later in the book); when she’s showering he climbs in with her and playfully washes her back, asks her to wash his back, some playful little sexual teasing and then he asks her to step out of the shower so he could finish his shower. This is intended as a playful Alpha invasion of her space in the shower as enjoyable attention. In fact the entire point of the routine is that you turn her on a bit, but then you don't have sex with her, it’s all a little bit of a tease toying with her.

If your wife is ovulating, playfully chasing her, escalating to a tickle fight and trying to pull her pants off might work a treat. Trying the same thing on her when she's starting to PMS... probably not so much.

Men aren’t allowed to use hormones as a defense for bad behavior, “Sorry your honor, the testosterone made me do it.” Neither should women be allowed to excuse bad behavior for their hormonal surges.

As an aside, if you’re out in the dating market, PMS is a reason why you shouldn’t wait 3-4 days to call a girl back. If you really click in the club when she’s near her ovulation sexual activation, the longer you wait to call her, the further you move from her ovulation and the closer you get to her PMS.

Phase Four – Stating Intentions Clearly This is a very short phase and shouldn’t last any longer than a week at the very most. Phase Four is where you make it clear that the situation is intolerable and that her choices of behavior are forcing you into an unwanted position, where you have to start seriously considering the possibility of having to leave the relationship. Phase Four is a direct statement of your needs that are not being met in the relationship and framing it as a problem that you can’t work any further on. After all, by this point you’ve made serious gains in your Sex Rank and that has taken a great deal of effort. The lack of sex and companionship in the relationship is now something that only she can give a solution for. The threat of you leaving is implied rather than directly threatened as something that could happen immediately. You are literally saying, “Staying in this relationship as it is now is clearly an unreasonable expectation you have of me.” You want her to fully understand the problem that you are experiencing in being with her. Possibly something to review with her is the matrix of how sexless marriages play out as covered in Chapter Eight. Explain that she has defrauded you of a reasonable expectation of marriage and that she has forced this issue on you. Explain that you have not had sex with anyone else and that there is not a secondary relationship in the background. Say that your hope and intent is to return to a sexual marriage with her, but she has to actively choose that option herself; you can’t force that choice, she has to want it. Otherwise, she forces you toward choosing one of the only remaining options for resolution, either you seeking extramarital sex or leaving to find someone new. Neither of which you find ideal. Also, be clear that you aren’t going to be impressed by merely her talking about restarting a sexual relationship, she does have to start showing signs of action towards that goal. You shouldn’t have an expectation of an immediate sexual frenzy, but you should have an expectation that she would regard this as the low point and start turning things around. Consistent positive progress is the key; she can’t just cry, have sex with you once, promise she’ll change and then resume as before as if nothing changed. Anything more than a week of no results and you move into Phase Five.

Drinking turns your nose red, it puts you to sleep, and it makes you urinate. Lust it turns on but also turns off. What I mean is, drinking stimulates desire but hinders performance. Therefore, too much drink is like a con artist when it comes to your sex drive. It sets you up for a fall. It gets you up but it keeps you from getting off. It persuades you and discourages you. It gives you an erection but doesn’t let you keep it, if you see what I’m saying. It makes you dream about erotic experiences, but then it leaves you asleep and needing to pee.

Rambling is a cardinal sin of storytelling, and it can be combated if you just think about summarizing yourself in one sentence first, then adding only the details pertinent to your big emotion and purpose afterwards, and filtering out those that don’t. When you focus on the point first, you are more likely to keep your joke short, snappy, and more effective. This maximizes its effect on the hearer.

Most of the girls who email me to hook up are pretty straightforward about it, but a large percentage of women lie to themselves about who they are and what they want. Ask them directly if they want to fuck me, and many will say no. But give them some bullshit white lie they can use to bridge the cognitive dissonance between what they say they want and what they actually want, and they will snatch it out of the sky like a falcon. After all, emailing me for sex is whorish and unseemly. But offering to wash my dirty clothes as a thank-you for writing such a great book, and then using it as a pretext for allowing a moment of premeditated spontaneity to just “happen,” that’s completely healthy and aboveboard. Riiiiiiiiiiiiight. What it’s also called is “whore logic.”

What consumed Pericles as a thinker and a public figure was how to get out of this trap, how to be truly rational in an arena dominated by emotions. The solution he came up with is unique in history and devastatingly powerful in its results. It should serve as our ideal. In his conception, the human mind has to worship something, has to have its attention directed to something it values above all else. For most people, it is their ego; for some it is their family, their clan, their god, or their nation. For Pericles it would be nous, the ancient Greek word for “mind” or “intelligence.” Nous is a force that permeates the universe, creating meaning and order. The human mind is naturally attracted to this order; this is the source of our intelligence. For Pericles, the nous that he worshipped was embodied in the figure of the goddess Athena.

To cultivate his inner Athena, Pericles first had to find a way to master his emotions. Emotions turn us inward, away from nous, away from reality. We dwell on our anger or our insecurities. If we look out at the world and try to solve problems, we see things through the lens of these emotions; they cloud our vision. Pericles trained himself to never react in the moment, to never make a decision while under the influence of a strong emotion. Instead, he analyzed his feelings. Usually when he looked closely at his insecurities or his anger, he saw that they were not really justified, and they lost their significance under scrutiny. Sometimes he had to physically get away from the heated Assembly and retire to his house, where he remained alone for days on end, calming himself down. Slowly, the voice of Athena would come to him.

Your first task is to look at those emotions that are continually infecting your ideas and decisions. Learn to question yourself: Why this anger or resentment? Where does this incessant need for attention come from? Under such scrutiny, your emotions will lose their hold on you. You will begin to think for yourself instead of reacting to what others give you. Emotions tend to narrow the mind, making us focus on one or two ideas that satisfy our immediate desire for power or attention, ideas that usually backfire. Now, with a calm spirit, you can entertain a wide range of options and solutions. You will deliberate longer before acting and reassess your strategies. The voice will become clearer and clearer. When people besiege you with their endless dramas and petty emotions, you will resent the distraction and apply your rationality to think past them. Like an athlete continually getting stronger through training, your mind will become more flexible and resilient. Clear and calm, you will see answers and creative solutions that no one else can envision.

Most significantly, our first reaction is to look outward for the cause. Yes, we might be responsible for some of what happened, but for the most part, other people and antagonistic forces tripped us up. This reaction is deeply ingrained in the human animal.

Bubbles occur because of the intense emotional pull they have on people, which overwhelms any reasoning powers an individual mind might possess. They stimulate our natural tendencies toward greed, easy money, and quick results. It is hard to see other people making money and not join in. There is no regulatory force on the planet that can control human nature. And because we do not confront the real source of the problem, bubbles and crashes keep repeating, and will keep repeating as long as there are suckers and people who do not read history. The recurrence of this mirrors the recurrence in our own lives of the same problems and mistakes, forming negative patterns. It is hard to learn from experience when we are not looking inward, at the true causes.

As many neuroscientists have affirmed, this evolution has led to the higher mammalian brain being composed of three parts. The oldest is the reptilian part of the brain, which controls all automatic responses that regulate the body. This is the instinctive part. Above that is the old mammalian or limbic brain, governing feeling and emotion. And on top of that has evolved the neocortex, the part that controls cognition and, for humans, language.

Many might be tempted to imagine that we have somehow tamed this Emotional Self through all of our intellectual and technological progress. After all, we don’t appear as violent or passionate or superstitious as our ancestors; but this is an illusion. Progress and technology have not rewired us; they have merely altered the forms of our emotions and the type of irrationality that comes with them. For instance, new forms of media have enhanced the age-old ability of politicians and others to play on our emotions, in ever subtler and more sophisticated ways. Advertisers bombard us with highly effective subliminal messages. Our continual connection to social media makes us prone to new forms of viral emotional effects. These are not media designed for calm reflection. With their constant presence, we have less and less mental space to step back and think. We are as besieged with emotions and needless drama as the Athenians in the Assembly, because human nature has not changed.

We constantly feel emotions, and they continually infect our thinking, making us veer toward thoughts that please us and soothe our egos. It is impossible to not have our inclinations and feelings somehow involved in what we think. Rational people are aware of this and through introspection and effort are able, to some extent, to subtract emotions from their thinking and counteract their effect. Irrational people have no such awareness. They rush into action without carefully considering the ramifications and consequences.

On the internet, it is easy to find studies that support both sides of an argument. In general, you should never accept the validity of people’s ideas because they have supplied “evidence.” Instead, examine the evidence yourself in the cold light of day, with as much skepticism as you can muster. Your first impulse should always be to find the evidence that disconfirms your most cherished beliefs and those of others. That is true science.

The way to recognize this in yourself and in others is by noticing behavior that is suddenly childish in its intensity and seemingly out of character. This could center on any key emotion. It could be fear—of losing control, of failure. In this case, we react by withdrawing from the situation and the presence of others, like a child curling up into a ball. A sudden illness, brought on by the intense fear, will conveniently cause us to have to leave the scene. It could be love—desperately searching to re-create a close parental or sibling relationship in the present, triggered by someone who vaguely reminds us of the lost paradise. It could be extreme mistrust, originating from an authority figure in early childhood who disappointed or betrayed us, generally the father. This often triggers a sudden rebellious attitude.

In some ways, we are programmed to repeat the early experience in the present. Our only defense is awareness as it is happening. We can recognize a trigger point by the experience of emotions that are unusually primal, more uncontrollable than normal. They trigger tears, deep depression, or excessive hope. People under the spell of these emotions will often have a very different tone of voice and body language, as if they were physically reliving a moment from early life. In the midst of such an attack, we must struggle to detach ourselves and contemplate the possible source—the wound in early childhood—and the patterns it has locked us into. This deep understanding of ourselves and our vulnerabilities is a key step toward becoming rational.

In fact, stress or tension can reveal flaws in people that they have carefully concealed from view. It is often wise to observe people in such moments, precisely as a way to judge their true character. Whenever you notice rising pressure and stress levels in your life, you must watch yourself carefully. Monitor any signs of unusual brittleness or sensitivity, sudden suspicions, fears disproportionate to the circumstances. Observe with as much detachment as possible, finding time and space to be alone. You need perspective. Never imagine that you are someone who can withstand rising stress without emotional leakage. It is not possible. But through self-awareness and reflection you can prevent yourself from making decisions you will come to regret.

It is best to recognize these inflamers by how they affect others, not just yourself. No one can remain indifferent to them. People find themselves incapable of reasoning or maintaining any distance in their presence. They make you think of them continually when not in their presence. They have an obsessive quality, and they can lead you to extreme actions as a devoted follower or as an inveterate enemy. On either end of the spectrum—attraction or repulsion—you will tend to be irrational and you will desperately need to distance yourself. A good strategy to utilize is to see through the front they project. They inevitably try to cast a larger-than-life image, a mythic, intimidating quality; but in fact they are all too human, full of the same insecurities and weaknesses we all possess. Try to recognize these very human traits and demythologize them.

The horse and rider must work together. This means we consider our actions beforehand; we bring as much thinking as possible to a situation before we make a decision. But once we decide what to do, we loosen the reins and enter action with boldness and a spirit of adventure. Instead of being slaves to this energy, we channel it. That is the essence of rationality.

“Trust your feelings!”—But feelings are nothing final or original; behind feelings there stand judgments and evaluations which we inherit in the form of . . . inclinations, aversions. . . . The inspiration born of a feeling is the grandchild of a judgment—and often of a false judgment!—and in any event not a child of your own! To trust one’s feelings—means to give more obedience to one’s grandfather and grandmother and their grandparents than to the gods which are in us: our reason and our experience. —Friedrich Nietzsche

Being socially awkward yet radiating superiority, they tend to alienate people, increasing their dangerous isolation. In both cases, drugs or alcohol or any other form of addiction can become a necessary crutch to soothe them in the inevitable moments of doubt and depression. You can recognize deep narcissists by the following behavior patterns: If they are ever insulted or challenged, they have no defense, nothing internal to soothe them or validate their worth. They generally react with great rage, thirsting for vengeance, full of a sense of righteousness. This is the only way they know how to assuage their insecurities. In such battles, they will position themselves as the wounded victim, confusing others and even drawing sympathy. They are prickly and oversensitive. Almost everything is taken personally. They can become quite paranoid and have enemies in all directions to point to. You can see an impatient or distant look on their face whenever you talk about something that does not directly involve them in some way. They immediately turn the conversation back to themselves, with some story or anecdote to distract from the insecurity behind it. They can be prone to vicious bouts of envy if they see others getting the attention they feel they deserve. They frequently display extreme self-confidence. This always helps to gain attention, and it neatly covers up their gaping inner emptiness and their fragmented sense of self. But beware if this confidence is ever truly put to the test.

You must try to run counter to these developments and create empathic energy. Each side of the spectrum has its peculiar momentum. Deep narcissism tends to sink you deeper, as your connection to reality lessens and you are unable to really develop your work or your relationships. Empathy does the opposite. As you increasingly turn your attention outward, you get constant positive feedback. People want to be around you more. You develop your empathic muscle; your work improves; without trying, you gain the attention that all humans thrive on. Empathy creates its own upward, positive momentum.

The greatest danger you face is your general assumption that you really understand people and that you can quickly judge and categorize them. Instead, you must begin with the assumption that you are ignorant and that you have natural biases that will make you judge people incorrectly. The people around you present a mask that suits their purposes. You mistake the mask for reality. Let go of your tendency to make snap judgments. Open your mind to seeing people in a new light. Do not assume that you are similar or that they share your values.

The best place to begin this transformation in your attitude is in your numerous daily conversations. Try reversing your normal impulse to talk and give your opinion, desiring instead to hear the other person’s point of view. You have tremendous curiosity in this direction. Cut off your incessant interior monologue as best you can. Give full attention to the other. What matters here is the quality of your listening, so that in the course of the conversation you can mirror back to the other person things they said, or things that were left unsaid but that you sensed. This will have a tremendous seductive effect.

Finally, adopting this attitude depends on the quality of your self-love. If you feel terribly superior to others, or gripped by insecurities, your moments of empathy and absorption in people will be shallow. What you need is a complete acceptance of your character, including your flaws, which you can see clearly but even appreciate and love. You are not perfect. You are not an angel. You have the same nature as others. With this attitude, you can laugh at yourself and let slights wash over you. From a position of genuine inner strength and resilience, you can more easily direct your attention outward.

As an adjunct to this, mirroring people on any level will draw out an empathic response from them. This can be physical, and is known as the chameleon effect. People who are connecting physically and emotionally in a conversation will tend to mimic each other’s gestures and posture, both crossing their legs, for instance. To a degree, you can do this consciously to induce a connection by deliberately mimicking someone. Similarly, nodding your head as they talk and smiling will deepen the connection. Even better, you can enter the spirit of the other person. You absorb their mood deeply and reflect it back to them. You create a feeling of rapport. People secretly crave this emotional rapport in their daily lives, because they get it so rarely. It has a hypnotic effect and appeals to people’s narcissism as you become their mirror.

In general people love to talk about themselves and their past, and it is usually quite easy to get them to open up. Look for trigger points (see chapter 1) that indicate points of extreme sensitivity. If they come from another culture, it is all the more important to understand this culture from within their experience. Your goal in general is to find out what makes them unique. You are looking precisely for what is different from yourself and the other people you know.

To work on this skill, keep several things in mind: The more people you interact with in the flesh, the better you will get at this. And the greater the variety of people you meet, the more versatile your skill will become. Also, keep a sense of flow. Your ideas about people never quite settle into a judgment. In an encounter, keep your attention active to see how the other person changes over the course of a conversation and the effect you are having on them. Be alive to the moment. Try to see people as they interact with others besides you—people are often very different depending on the person they are involved with. Try to focus not on categories but on the feeling tone and mood that people evoke in you, which is continually shifting.

The key to employing empathy within a relationship is to understand the value system of the other person, which inevitably is different from yours. What they interpret as signs of love or attention or generosity tends to diverge from your way of thinking. These value systems are largely formed in early childhood and are not consciously created by people. Keeping in mind their value system will allow you to enter their spirit and perspective precisely in the moment you would normally turn defensive. Even deep narcissists can be pulled out of their shell in this way, because such attention is so rare. Measure all of your relationships on the narcissism spectrum. It is not one person or the other but the dynamic itself that must be altered.

First you must recognize your state of self-absorption and how little you actually observe. With this understanding you will be motivated to develop observation skills. Second you must understand, as Erickson did, the different nature of this form of communication. It requires opening up your senses and relating to people more on the physical level, absorbing their physical energy and not just their words. You do not simply observe their facial expression, but you register it from within, so that the impression stays with you and communicates. As you gain greater vocabulary in this language, you will be able to correlate a gesture with a possible emotion. As your sensitivity increases, you will begin to notice more and more of what you have been missing. And equally important, you will discover a new and deeper way of relating to people, with the increased social powers this will bring you.

Your task as a student of human nature is twofold: First, you must understand and accept the theatrical quality of life. You do not moralize and rail against the role-playing and the wearing of masks so essential to smooth social functioning. In fact, your goal is to play your part on the stage of life with consummate skill, attracting attention, dominating the limelight, and making yourself into a sympathetic hero or heroine. Second, you must not be naive and mistake people’s appearances for reality. You are not blinded by people’s acting skills.

These include the sudden squinting of the eyes at something you have said, the glare, the pursing of the lips until they nearly disappear, the stiff neck, the torso or feet that turn away from you while you are still engaged in a conversation, the folding of the arms as you try to make a point, and an overall tenseness in the body. The problem is that you will not usually see such signs unless a person’s displeasure has become too strong to conceal at all.

There is no genuine smile without a definite change in the eyes and cheeks. Some people will try to create the impression of the genuine variety by putting on a very broad smile, which will partially alter the eyes as well. So in addition to the physical signs, you must look at the context. The genuine smile usually comes from some action or words that suddenly elicit the response; it is spontaneous. Is the smile in this case somewhat unrelated to the circumstances, not warranted by what was said? Is it a situation in which a person is straining to impress or has strategic goals in mind? Is the timing of the smile slightly off?

Confidence usually comes with a greater feeling of relaxation that is clearly reflected in the face, and with a greater freedom of movement. Those who are powerful will feel allowed to look around more at others, choosing to make eye contact with whomever they please. Their eyelids are more closed, a sign of seriousness and competence. If they feel bored or annoyed, they show it more freely and openly. They often smile less, frequent smiling being a sign of overall insecurity. They feel more entitled to touch people, such as with friendly pats on the back or on the arm. In a meeting, they will tend to take up more space and create more distance around themselves. They stand taller, and their gestures are relaxed and comfortable. Most important, others feel compelled to imitate their style and mannerisms.

Finally, use the knowledge you glean from these cues as a valuable means of gauging the levels of confidence in people and acting appropriately. With leaders who are riddled with insecurities that poke through nonverbally, you can play to their insecurities and gain power through this, but often it is best to avoid attaching yourself too closely to such types, as they tend to do poorly over time and can drag you down with them. With those who are not leaders but are trying to assert themselves as if they were, your response should depend on their personality type. If they are rising stars, full of self-belief and a sense of destiny, it might be wise to try to rise with them. You will notice such types by the positive energy that surrounds them. On the other hand, if they are simply arrogant and petty despots, these are precisely the types you should always strive to avoid, as they are masters at making others pay lip service to them without giving anything in return.

They are playing on the conviction bias (see chapter 1)—if I deny or say something with so much gusto, with an air of being a victim, it is hard to doubt me. We tend to take extra conviction for truth. In fact, when people try to explain their ideas with so much exaggerated energy, or defend themselves with an intense level of denial, that is precisely when you should raise your antennae.

Looking at this from the other side, as a character in Dostoyevsky’s novel The Idiot advised, “When you are lying, if you skillfully put in something not quite ordinary, something eccentric, something, you know, that never has happened, or very rarely, it makes the lie sound much more probable.”

In general, the best thing to do when you suspect people of trying to distract you from the truth is not to actively confront them in the beginning, but in fact to encourage them to continue by showing interest in what they are saying or doing. You want them to talk more, to reveal more signs of tension and contrivance. At the right moment you must surprise them with a question or remark that is designed to make them uncomfortable, revealing you are onto them.

But in fact it is best to simply ignore this lower end. Polite, civilized society depends on the ability to say things that are not always sincere. It would be too damaging socially to become constantly aware of this subrealm of deception. Save your alertness for those situations in which the stakes are higher and people might be angling to get something valuable out of you.

Learn how to consciously put yourself in the right emotional mood by imagining how and why you should feel the emotion suitable to the occasion or performance you are about to give. Surrender to the feeling for the moment so that the face and body are naturally animated. Sometimes by actually making yourself smile or frown, you will experience some of the emotions that go with these expressions. Just as important, train yourself to return to a more neutral expression at a natural moment, careful to not go too far with your emoting.

In the modern world, this means showing yourself as progressive, supremely tolerant, and open-minded. You will want to be seen giving generously to certain causes and supporting them on social media. Projecting sincerity and honesty always plays well. A few public confessions of your weaknesses and vulnerabilities will do the trick. For some reason people see signs of humility as authentic, even though people might very well be simulating them. Learn how to occasionally lower your head and appear humble. If dirty work must be done, get others to do it. Your hands are clean. Never overtly play the Machiavellian leader—that only works well on television. Use the appropriate dominance cues to make people think you are powerful, even before you reach the heights. You want to seem like you were destined for success, a mystical effect that always works.

Instead of determining people’s character—their ability to work with others, to keep to their promises, to remain strong in adverse circumstances—we choose to work with or hire people based on their glittering résumé, their intelligence, and their charm. But even a positive trait such as intelligence is worthless if the person also happens to be of weak or dubious character.

We can often notice this phenomenon more clearly in the actions of others, particularly those closest to us. For instance, we see friends continually fall for exactly the wrong person or unconsciously push away the right person. We cringe at some foolish behavior of theirs, such as an ill-considered investment or career choice, only to see them repeat the foolishness a few years later, once they have forgotten the lesson. Or we know someone who always manages to offend the wrong person at the wrong time, creating hostility wherever he or she goes. Or they crumble under pressure, always in the same way, but blaming others or bad luck for what happens. And of course we know the addicts who get out of their addiction, only to fall back in or find some other form of addiction. We see these patterns and they don’t, because nobody likes to believe that they are operating under some kind of compulsion beyond their control. It is too disturbing a thought. If we are honest with ourselves, we must admit there is some truth to the concept of fate. We are prone to repeat the same decisions and methods of dealing with problems. There is a pattern to our life, particularly visible in our mistakes and failures. But there is a different way of looking at this concept: it is not spirits or gods that control us but rather our character. The etymology of the word character, from the ancient Greek, refers to an engraving or stamping instrument. Character, then, is something that is so deeply ingrained or stamped within us that it compels us to act in certain ways, beyond our awareness and control. We can conceive of this character as having three essential components, each layered on top of the other, giving this character depth. The earliest and deepest layer comes from genetics, from the particular way our brains

As a student of human nature your task is twofold: First you must come to understand your own character, examining as best you can the elements in your past that have gone into forming it, and the patterns, mostly negative, that you can see recurring in your life. It is impossible to get rid of this stamp that constitutes your character. It is too deep. But through awareness, you can learn to mitigate or stop certain negative patterns. You can work to transform the negative and weak aspects of your character into actual strengths. You can try to create new habits and patterns that go with them through practice, actively shaping your character and the destiny that goes with it.

In general, people can be divided into introverts and extroverts, and this will play a large role in the character they develop. Extroverts are largely governed by external criteria. The question that dominates them is “What do others think of me?” They will tend to like what other people like, and the groups they belong to frequently determine the opinions they hold. They are open to suggestion and new ideas, but only if they are popular in the culture or asserted by some authority they respect. Extroverts value external things—good clothes, great meals, concrete enjoyment shared with others. They are in search of new and novel sensations and have a nose for trends. They are not only comfortable with noise and bustle but actively search it out. If they are bold, they love physical adventure. If they are not so bold, they love creature comforts. In any event, they crave stimulation and attention from others.

Introverts are more sensitive and easily exhausted by too much outward activity. They like to conserve their energy, to spend time alone or with one or two close friends. As opposed to extroverts, who are fascinated by facts and statistics for their own sake, introverts are interested in their own opinions and feelings. They love to theorize and come up with their own ideas. If they produce something, they do not like to promote it; they find the effort distasteful. What they make should sell itself. They like to keep a part of their life separate from others, to have secrets. Their opinions do not come from what others think or from any authority but from their inner criteria, or at least they think so. The bigger the crowd, the more lost and lonely they feel. They can seem awkward and mistrustful, uncomfortable with attention. They also tend to be more pessimistic and worried than the average extrovert. Their boldness will be expressed by the novel ideas they come up with and their creativity.

The Personalizer: These people seem so sensitive and thoughtful, a rare and nice quality. They might seem a little sad, but sensitive people can have it rough in life. You are often drawn in by this air of theirs, and want to help. Also, they can appear quite intelligent, considerate, and good to work with. What you come to realize later on is that their sensitivity really only goes in one direction—inward. They are prone to take everything that people say or do as personal. They tend to brood over things for days, long after you have forgotten some innocuous comment that they have taken personally. As children, they had a gnawing feeling that they never got enough from their parents—love, attention, material possessions. As they get older, everything tends to remind them of what they didn’t get. They go through life resenting this and wanting others to give them things without their having to ask. They are constantly on guard—are you paying them attention, do you respect them, are you giving them what they paid for? Being somewhat irritable and touchy, they inevitably push people away, which makes them even more sensitive. At some point they start to have a look of perpetual disappointment. You will see in their life a pattern of many falling-outs with people, but they will always see themselves as the wronged party. Do not ever inadvertently insult such a type. They have a long memory and can spend years getting back at you.

The Drama Magnet: They will draw you in with their exciting presence. They have unusual energy and stories to tell. Their features are animated and they can be quite witty. They are fun to be around, until the drama turns ugly. As children, they learned that the only way to get love and attention that lasted was to enmesh their parents in their troubles and problems, which had to be large enough to engage the parents emotionally over time. This became a habit, their way of feeling alive and wanted. Most people shrink from any kind of confrontation, but they seem to live for it. As you get to know them better, you hear more stories of bickering and battles in their life, but they manage to always position themselves as the victim. You must realize that their greatest need is to get their hooks into you by any means possible. They will embroil you in their drama to the point that you will feel guilty for disengaging. It is best to recognize them as early as possible, before you become enmeshed and dragged down. Examine their past for evidence of the pattern and run for the hills if you suspect you are dealing with such a type.

The other direction is harder to take, but it is the only path that leads to true power and the formation of a superior character. It works in the following manner: You examine yourself as thoroughly as possible. You look at the deepest layers of your character, determining whether you are an introvert or extrovert, whether you tend to be governed by high levels of anxiety and sensitivity, or hostility and anger, or a profound need to engage with people. You look at your primal inclinations—those subjects and activities you are naturally drawn to. You examine the quality of attachments you formed with your parents, looking at your current relationships as the best sign of this. You look with rigorous honesty at your own mistakes and the patterns that continually hold you back. You know your limitations—those situations in which you do not do your best. You also become aware of the natural strengths in your character that have survived past adolescence.

Finally, you need to also refine or cultivate those traits that go into a strong character—resilience under pressure, attention to detail, the ability to complete things, to work with a team, to be tolerant of people’s differences. The only way to do so is to work on your habits, which go into the slow formation of your character. For instance, you train yourself to not react in the moment by repeatedly placing yourself in stressful or adverse situations in order to get used to them. In boring everyday tasks, you cultivate greater patience and attention to detail. You deliberately take on tasks slightly above your level. In completing them, you have to work harder, helping you establish more discipline and better work habits. You train yourself to continually think of what is best for the team. You also search out others who display a strong character and associate with them as much as possible. In this way you can assimilate their energy and their habits. And to develop some flexibility in your character, always a sign of strength, you occasionally shake yourself up, trying out some new strategy or way of thinking, doing the opposite of what you would normally do.

Understand: Just like Chanel, you need to reverse your perspective. Instead of focusing on what you want and covet in the world, you must train yourself to focus on others, on their repressed desires and unmet fantasies. You must train yourself to see how they perceive you and the objects you make, as if you were looking at yourself and your work from the outside. This will give you the almost limitless power to shape people’s perceptions about these objects and excite them. People do not want truth and honesty, no matter how much we hear such nonsense endlessly repeated. They want their imaginations to be stimulated and to be taken beyond their banal circumstances. They want fantasy and objects of desire to covet and grope after. Create an air of mystery around you and your work. Associate it with something new, unfamiliar, exotic, progressive, and taboo. Do not define your message but leave it vague. Create an illusion of ubiquity—your object is seen everywhere and desired by others. Then let the covetousness so latent in all humans do the rest, setting off a chain reaction of desire.

One of the most striking examples of this syndrome is the view we take of our childhood as it recedes into the past. Most of us remember a golden time of play and excitement. As we get older, it becomes even more golden in our memory. Of course, we conveniently forget the anxieties, insecurities, and hurts that plagued us in childhood and more than likely consumed more of our mental space than the fleeting pleasures we remember. But because our youth is an object that grows more distant as we age, we are able to idealize it and see it as greener than green.

Your presence must have a touch of coldness to it, as if you feel like you could do without others. This signals to people that you consider yourself worthy of respect, which unconsciously heightens your value in their eyes. It makes people want to chase after you. This touch of coldness is the first form of withdrawal that you must practice. Add to this a bit of blankness and ambiguity as to who you are. Your opinions, values, and tastes are never too obvious to people. This gives them room to read into you what they want.

With relationships, we can spend our life searching for the perfect man or woman and end up largely alone. There is nobody perfect. Instead, it is better to come to terms with the flaws of the other person and accept them or even find some charm in their weaknesses. Calming down our covetous desires, we can then learn the arts of compromise and how to make a relationship work, which never come easily or naturally. Instead of constantly chasing after the latest trends and modeling our desires on what others find exciting, we should spend our time getting to know our own tastes and desires better, so that we can distinguish what is something we truly need or want from that which has been manufactured by advertisers or viral effects. Life is short and we have only so much energy. Led by our covetous desires, we can waste so much time in futile searches and changes. In general, do not constantly wait and hope for something better, but rather make the most of what you have. Consider it this way: You are embedded in an environment that consists of the people you know and the places you frequent. This is your reality. Your mind is being continually drawn far away from this reality, because of human nature. You dream of traveling to exotic places, but if you go there, you merely drag with you your own discontented frame of mind. You search for entertainment that will bring you new fantasies to feed upon. You read books filled with ideas that have no relation to your daily life, that are full of empty speculations about things that only half exist. And none of this turmoil and ceaseless desire for what is most distant ever leads to anything fulfilling—it only stirs up more chimeras to pursue. In the end you cannot escape from yourself. On the other hand, reality beckons you. To absorb your mind in what is nearest, instead of most distant, brings a much different feeling. With the people in your circle, you can always connect on a deeper level. There is much you will never know about the people you deal with, and this can be a source of endless fascination. You can connect more deeply to your environment. The place where you live has a deep history that you can immerse yourself in. Knowing your environment better will present many opportunities for power. As for yourself, you have mysterious corners you can never fully understand. In trying to know yourself better, you can take charge of your own nature instead of being a slave to it. And your work has endless possibilities for improvement and innovation, endless challenges for the imagination. These are the things that are closest to you and compose your real, not virtual world. In the end what you really must covet is a deeper relationship to reality, which will bring you calmness, focus, and practical powers to alter what it is possible to alter.

If possible, avoid deep contact with those whose time frame is narrow, who are in continual react mode, and strive to associate with those with an expanded awareness of time. Four Signs of Shortsightedness and Strategies to Overcome Them Most of us imagine that we engage in some form of long-term thinking; after all, we have goals and plans. But really we are fooling ourselves. We can see this most clearly when we talk to other people about their plans and strategies for the near and more distant future: we are often struck by their vagueness and the lack of deep thinking people generally give to such plans. They are more like hopes and wishes, and in the rush of immediate events, feeling pressure and the need to respond, such weak goals and plans are easily overwhelmed. Most of the time we are improvising and reacting to events with insufficient information. Basically

The source of this age-old syndrome is relatively simple: alarmed by something in the present, we grab for a solution without thinking deeply about the context, the roots of the problem, the possible unintended consequences that might ensue. Because we mostly react instead of think, our actions are based on insufficient information—Caesar was not planning to start a monarchy; the poor people of Delhi despised their colonial rulers and would not take kindly to suddenly losing money; Americans would be willing to go to war if attacked.

The only solution is to back out temporarily or permanently from these battles, particularly if they are occurring on several fronts. You need some detachment and perspective. Get your ego to calm down. Remind yourself that winning an argument or proving your point really gets you nowhere in the long run. Win through your actions, not your words. Start to think again about your long-term goals. Create a ladder of values and priorities in your life, reminding yourself of what really matters to you. If you determine that a particular battle is in fact important, with a greater sense of detachment you can now plot a more strategic response.

Lincoln provides the model for us all and the antidote to the fever. First and foremost we must develop patience, which is like a muscle that requires training and repetition to make it strong. Lincoln was a supremely patient man. When we face any kind of problem or obstacle, we must follow his example and make an effort to slow things down and step back, wait a day or two before taking action. Second, when faced with issues that are important, we must have a clear sense of our long-term goals and how to attain them. Part of this involves assessing the relative strengths and weaknesses of the parties involved. Such clarity will allow us to withstand the constant emotional overreactions of those around us. Finally, it is important to have faith that time will eventually prove us right and to maintain our resolve.

This means you do not see the passage of time as an enemy but rather as a great ally. Each stage in life has its advantages—those of youth are most obvious, but with age comes greater perspective. Aging does not frighten you. Death is equally your friend (see chapter 18). It motivates you to make the most of each moment; it gives you a sense of urgency. Time is your great teacher and master. This affects you deeply in the present. Awareness that a year from now this current problem you are experiencing will hardly seem so important will help you lower your anxiety and adjust your priorities. Knowing that time will reveal the weaknesses of your plans, you become more careful and deliberative with them.

In relation to the future, you think deeply about your long-term goals. They are not vague dreams but concrete objectives, and you have mapped out a path to reach them. In relation to the past, you feel a deep sense of connection to your childhood. Yes, you are constantly changing, but these changes are on the surface and create the illusion of real change. In fact, your character was set in your earliest years (see chapter 4), along with your inclinations toward certain activities, your likes and dislikes. As you get older, this character only becomes more apparent. Feeling organically connected to who you were in the past gives you a strong sense of identity. You know what you like and dislike, you know who you are. This will help you maintain your self-love, which is so critical in resisting the descent into deep narcissism and in helping you to develop empathy (see chapter 2). Also, you will pay greater attention to the mistakes and lessons of the past, which those who

We must discover the power that we can possess by giving people the validation they crave and lowering their defenses. And the key to making this happen in a realistic and strategic manner is to fully understand a fundamental law of human nature. This law is as follows: People have a perception about themselves that we shall call their self-opinion. This self-opinion can be accurate or not—it doesn’t matter. What matters is how people perceive their own character and worthiness.

Finally, when giving people gifts or rewards as a possible means of winning them over to your side, it is always best to give smaller gifts or rewards than larger ones. Large gifts make it too apparent that you are trying to buy their loyalty, which will offend people’s sense of independence. Some might accept large gifts out of need, but later they will feel resentful or suspicious. Smaller gifts have a better effect—people can tell themselves they deserve such things and are not being bought or bribed. In fact, such smaller rewards, spread out over time, will bind people to you in a much greater way than anything lavish.

The nineteenth-century British prime minister and novelist Benjamin Disraeli conceived of an even cleverer ploy when he wrote, “If you wish to win a man’s heart, allow him to confute you.” You do this by beginning to disagree with a target about a subject, even with some vehemence, and then slowly come to seeing their point of view, thereby confirming not only their intelligence but also their own powers of influence. They feel ever so slightly superior to you, which is precisely what you want. They will now be doubly vulnerable to a countermove of your own. You can create a similar effect by asking people for advice. The implication is that you respect their wisdom and experience.

Finally, if you need a favor from people, do not remind them of what you have done for them in the past, trying to stimulate feelings of gratitude. Gratitude is rare because it tends to remind us of our helplessness, our dependence on others. We like to feel independent. Instead, remind them of the good things they have done for you in the past. This will help confirm their self-opinion: “Yes, I am generous.” And once reminded, they will want to continue to live up to this image and do yet another good deed. A similar effect can come from suddenly forgiving your enemies and forging a rapprochement. In the emotional turmoil this creates, they will feel obligated to live up to the high opinion you have now shown toward them and will be extra motivated to prove themselves worthy.

Second, the best strategy is to praise and flatter those qualities that people are most insecure about. We all crave this, even if we somehow see through the person who is praising us. That is because we live in a tough world in which we are continually judged, and yesterday’s triumph is easily followed by tomorrow’s failure. We never really feel secure.

Flattering them about their clever manipulations might backfire, but obvious praise of their goodness would be too transparent, because they know themselves too well.

When people are rigid in their opposition to something, it stems from deep fear of change and the uncertainty it could bring. They must have everything on their terms and feel in control. You play into their hands if you try with all your advice to encourage change—it gives them something to react against and justifies their rigidity. They become more stubborn. Stop fighting with such people and use the actual nature of their rigid behavior to effect a gentle change that could lead to something greater. On their own, they discover something new (like the power of Buddhist prayer), and on their own they might take this further, all set up by your judo maneuver. Keep in mind the following: people often won’t do what others ask them to do, because they simply want to assert their will. If you heartily agree with their rebellion and tell them to keep on doing what they’re doing, it now means that if they do so they are following your advice, which is distasteful to them. They may very well rebel again and assert their will in the opposite direction, which is what you wanted all along—the essence of reverse psychology

Finally, when it comes to your own self-opinion, try to have some ironic distance from it. Make yourself aware of its existence and how it operates within you. Come to terms with the fact that you are not as free and autonomous as you like to believe. You do conform to the opinions of the groups you belong to; you do buy products because of subliminal influence; you can be manipulated. Realize as well that you are not as good as the idealized image of your self-opinion. Like everyone else, you can be quite self-absorbed and obsessed with your own agenda. With this awareness, you will not feel the need to be validated by others. Instead you will work at making yourself truly independent and concerned with the welfare of others, as opposed to staying attached to the illusion of your self-opinion.

This freedom essentially comes from adopting a generous spirit—toward others and toward ourselves. By accepting people, by understanding and if possible even loving them for their human nature, we can liberate our minds from obsessive and petty emotions. We can stop reacting to everything people do and say. We can have some distance and stop ourselves from taking everything personally. Mental space is freed up for higher pursuits. When we feel generous toward others, they feel drawn to us and want to match our spirit. When we feel generous toward ourselves, we no longer feel the need to bow and scrape and play the game of false humility while secretly resenting our lack of success. Through our work and through getting what we need on our own, without depending on others, we can stand tall and realize our potential as humans. We can stop reproducing the negative emotions around us. Once we feel the exhilarating power from this new attitude, we will want to take it as far as possible.

Although attitudes come in many varieties and blends, we can generally categorize them as negative and narrow or positive and expansive. Those with a negative attitude tend to operate from a basic position of fear toward life. They unconsciously want to limit what they see and experience to give them more control. Those with a positive attitude have a much less fearful approach. They are open to new experiences, ideas, and emotions. If the attitude is like our lens on the world, the negative attitude narrows the aperture of this lens, and the positive variety expands it as far as possible. We might move between these two poles, but generally we tend to see the world with a more closed or open lens.

Second, you must not only be aware of the role of your attitude but also believe in its supreme power to alter your circumstances. You are not a pawn in a game controlled by others; you are an active player who can move the pieces at will and even rewrite the rules. View your health as largely dependent on your attitude. Feeling excited and open to adventure, you can tap into energy reserves you did not know that you had. The mind and the body are one, and your thoughts affect your physical responses. People can recover much more quickly from illness through sheer desire and willpower. You are not born with fixed intelligence and inherent limits. See your brain as a miraculous organ designed for continual learning and improvement, well into old age. The rich neural connections in your brain, your creative powers, are something you develop to the degree that you open yourself up to new experiences and ideas. View problems and failures as means to learn and toughen yourself up. You can get through anything with persistence.

If you notice traces of this attitude in yourself, a good strategy is to take on a project of even the smallest scale, taking it all the way to completion and embracing the prospect of failure. If you fail, you will have already cushioned the blow because you anticipated it, and inevitably it will not hurt as much as you had imagined. Your self-esteem will rise because you finally tried something and finished it. Once you diminish this fear, progress will be easy. You will want to try again. And if you succeed, all the better.

Most of us have depressive tendencies and moments. The best way to handle them is to be aware of their necessity—they are our body’s and mind’s way of compelling us to slow down, to lower our energies and withdraw. Depressive cycles can serve positive purposes. The solution is to realize their usefulness and temporary quality. The depression you feel today will not be with you in a week, and you can ride it out. If possible, find ways to elevate your energy level, which will physically help lift you out of the mood. The best way to handle recurrent depression is to channel your energies into work, especially the arts. You are used to withdrawing and being alone; use such time to tap into your unconscious. Externalize your unusual sensitivity and your dark feelings into the work itself.

It is better to explode into anger in the moment, even it if it’s irrational, than to stew on slights that you have probably hallucinated or exaggerated. People are generally indifferent to your fate, not as antagonistic as you imagine. Very few of their actions are really directed at you. Stop seeing everything in personal terms. Respect is something that must be earned through your achievements, not something given to you simply for being human.

How to view other people: First you must try to get rid of the natural tendency to take what people do and say as something personally directed at you, particularly if what they say or do is unpleasant. Even when they criticize you or act against your interests, more often than not it stems from some deep earlier pain they are reliving; you become the convenient target of frustrations and resentments that have been accumulating over the years. They are projecting their own negative feelings. If you can view people this way, you will find it easier to not react and get upset or become embroiled in some petty battle.

Your goal must be to always move in the opposite direction. You rediscover the curiosity you once had as a child. Everything and everyone is a source of fascination to you. You keep learning, continually expanding what you know and what you experience. With people you feel generous and tolerant, even with your enemies and with those trapped in the soulless condition. You do not enslave yourself to bitterness or rancor. Instead of blaming others or circumstances, you see the role that your own attitude and actions played in any failure. You adapt to circumstances instead of complaining about them. You accept and embrace uncertainty and the unexpected as valuable qualities of life. In this way, your soul expands to the contours of life itself and fills itself with this life force.

We are drawn toward what is outwardly forbidden—sexually or socially. We may resort to alcohol or drugs or any stimulant, because we feel our senses dulled, our minds too restrained by convention. If we accumulate a lot of hurts and resentments along the way, which we strive to conceal from others, the Shadow grows thicker. If we experience success in our lives, we become addicted to positive attention, and in the inevitable down moments when the drug of such attention wears off, the Shadow will be disturbed and activated.

You might entertain the notion that this concept of the Shadow is somewhat antiquated. After all, we live in a much more rational, scientifically oriented culture today. People are more transparent and self-aware than ever, we might say. We are much less repressed than our ancestors, who had to deal with all sorts of pressures from organized religion. The truth, however, might very well be the opposite. In many ways we are more split than ever between our conscious, social selves and our unconscious Shadow. We live in a culture that enforces powerful codes of correctness that we must abide by or face the shaming that is now so common on social media.

Instead the answer is to see our Shadow in action and become more self-aware. It is hard to project onto others our own secret impulses or to overidealize some cause, once we are made aware of the mechanism operating within us. Through such self-knowledge we can find a way to integrate the dark side into our consciousness productively and creatively. (For more on this, see the last section of this chapter.) In doing so we become more authentic and complete, exploiting to the maximum the energies we naturally possess.

The Extreme Entrepreneur: At first glance these types seem to possess very positive qualities, especially for work. They maintain very high standards and pay exceptional attention to detail. They are willing to do much of the work themselves. If mixed with talent, this often leads to success early on in life. But underneath the façade the seeds of failure are taking root. This first appears in their inability to listen to others. They cannot take advice. They need no one. In fact, they mistrust others who do not have their same high standards. With success they are forced to take on more and more responsibility. If they were truly self-reliant, they would know the importance of delegating on a lower level to maintain control on the higher level, but something else is stirring within—the Shadow. Soon the situation becomes chaotic. Others must come in and take over the business. Their health and finances are ruined and they become completely dependent on doctors or outside financiers. They go from complete control to total dependence on others. (Think of the pop star Michael Jackson near the end of his life.) Often their outward show of self-reliance disguises a hidden desire to have others take care of them, to regress to the dependency of childhood. They can never admit this to themselves or show any signs of such weakness, but unconsciously they are drawn to creating enough chaos that they break down and are forced into some form of dependency. There are signs beforehand: recurring health issues, the sudden microneeds to be pampered by people in their daily lives. But the big sign comes as they lose control and fail to take steps to halt this. It is best to not get too entangled with such types later on in their careers, as they have a tendency to bring about much collateral damage.

It would be wise to look at those who are successful in their field. Inevitably we will see that most of them are much less bound by these codes. They are generally more assertive and overtly ambitious. They care much less what others think of them. They flout the conventions openly and proudly. And they are not punished but greatly rewarded. Steve Jobs is a classic example. He showed his rough, Shadow side in his way of working with others. Our tendency in looking at people like Jobs is to admire their creativity and subtract their darker qualities as unnecessary. If only he had been nicer, he would have been a saint. But in fact the dark side was inextricably interwoven with his power and creativity. His ability to not listen to others, to go his own way, and be a bit rough about it were key parts of his success, which we venerate. And so it is with many creative, powerful people. Subtract their active Shadow, and they would be like everyone else.

You pay a greater price for being so nice and deferential than for consciously showing your Shadow. First, to follow the latter path you must begin by respecting your own opinions more and those of others less, particularly when it comes to your areas of expertise, to the field you have immersed yourself in. Trust your native genius and the ideas you have come up with. Second, get in the habit in your daily life of asserting yourself more and compromising less. Do this under control and at opportune moments. Third, start caring less what people think of you. You will feel a tremendous sense of liberation. Fourth, realize that at times you must offend and even hurt people who block your path, who have ugly values, who unjustly criticize you. Use such moments of clear injustice to bring out your Shadow and show it proudly. Fifth, feel free to play the impudent, willful child who mocks the stupidity and hypocrisy of others.

Finally, flout the very conventions that others follow so scrupulously. For centuries, and still to this day, gender roles represent the most powerful convention of all. What men and women can do or say has been highly controlled, to the point where it seems almost to represent biological differences instead of social conventions.

Your task as a student of human nature is to transform yourself into a master decoder of envy. You are ruthless in your analysis and your determination to get to the root of what motivates people. The signs that people emit of envy are harder to discern, but they exist, and you can master the language with some effort and subtle discernment. Think of it as an intellectual challenge. By being able to decode it, you will not feel so confused. You will understand in hindsight that you suffered an envy attack, which will help you get over it. You might be able to see in advance the warning signs of such an attack and either defuse or deflect it. And knowing the hidden pain that comes from one well-aimed envy attack, you will spare yourself the emotional damage that can last for years. This will not make you paranoid but only better able to weed out the false and fatal friends (or colleagues) from the real ones, the ones you can truly trust.

Your task is to let go of the rigidity that takes hold of you as you overidentify with the expected gender role. Power lies in exploring that middle range between the masculine and the feminine, in playing against people’s expectations. Return to the harder or softer sides of your character that you have lost or repressed. In relating to people, expand your repertoire by developing greater empathy, or by learning to be less deferential. When confronting a problem or resistance from others, train yourself to respond in different ways—attacking when you normally defend, or vice versa. In your thinking, learn to blend the analytical with the intuitive in order to become more creative (see the final section of this chapter for more on this).

As adults we feel relatively mature and practical, but in love we can suddenly regress to behavior that can only be seen as childish. We experience fears and insecurities that are greatly exaggerated. We feel terror at the thought of being abandoned, like a baby who has been left alone for a few minutes. We have wild mood swings—from love to hate, from trust to paranoia.

Normally we like to imagine that we are good judges of other people’s character. Once infatuated or in love, however, we mistake the narcissist for a genius, the suffocator for a nurturer, the slacker for the exciting rebel, the control freak for the protector. Others can often see the truth and try to disabuse us of our fantasies, but we won’t listen. And what is worse, we will often continue to make the same types of mistaken judgments again and again.

For instance, small boys are often comfortable expressing emotions and traits that they’ve learned from the mother, such as overt affection, empathy, and sensitivity. Small girls, conversely, are often comfortable expressing traits they’ve learned from the father, such as aggression, boldness, intellectual rigor, and physical prowess. Each child may also naturally possess these opposite-gender traits in him- or herself. In addition, each parent will also have a shadow side that the child must assimilate or deal with. For instance, a mother may be narcissistic rather than empathetic, and a father may be domineering or weak rather than protective and strong. Children must adapt to this. In any event, the boy and the girl will internalize the positive and the negative qualities of the parent of the opposite sex in ways that are unconscious and profound. And the association with the parent of the opposite sex will be charged with all kinds of emotions—physical and sensual connections, tremendous feelings of excitement, fascination, or disappointment at what one was not given.

The unconscious feminine part of the boy and the man is what Jung calls the anima. The unconscious masculine part of the girl and woman are the animus. Because they are parts of ourselves that are deeply buried, we are never really aware of them in our daily life. But once we become fascinated with a person of the opposite sex, the anima and animus stir to life. The attraction we feel toward another might be purely physical, but more often the person who draws our attention unconsciously bears some resemblance—physical or psychological—to our mother or father. Remember that this primal relationship is full of charged energy, excitement, and obsessions that are repressed but yearning to come out. A person who triggers these associations in us will be a magnet for our attention, even though we are not aware of the source of our attraction. If the relationship to the mother or father was mostly positive, we will tend to project onto the other person the desirable qualities that our parent had, in the hope of reexperiencing that early paradise. Take, for instance, a young man whose mother nurtured and adored him. He may have been a sweet, loving little boy, devoted to his mother and reflecting her nurturing energy, but he repressed these traits in himself as he grew into an independent man with a masculine image to uphold. In the woman who triggers an association with his mother he will see the capacity to adore him that he secretly craves. This feeling of getting what he wants will intensify his excitement and physical attraction. She will supply him the qualities he never developed in himself. He is falling in love with his own anima, in the form of the desired woman.

Men of this type must recognize the nature of their pattern. What they really need is to find and interact with a real woman, accept her inevitable flaws, and give more of themselves. They often prefer to chase their fantasy, because in such a scenario they are in control and have the freedom to leave when reality sets in. To break the pattern, such men will have to give up some of this control. When it comes to their need for a muse, they must learn to find such inspiration from within, to bring out more of the anima within themselves. They are too alienated from their own feminine spirit and need to loosen up their own thought processes. Not needing this wildness from their fantasy woman, they will better relate to the actual women in their life.

The Woman to Worship Him: He’s driven and ambitious, but his life is hard. It’s a harsh, unforgiving world out there, and it’s not easy to find any comfort. He feels something missing in his life. Then along comes a woman who is attentive to him, warm, and engaging. She seems to admire him. He feels overwhelmingly drawn to her and her energy. This is the woman to complete him, to help comfort him. But then, as the relationship develops, she no longer seems quite so nice and attentive. She certainly has stopped admiring him. He concludes that she has deceived him or has changed. Such a betrayal makes him angry. This male projection generally stems from a particular type of relationship with the mother—she adores her son and showers him with attention. Perhaps this is to compensate for never quite getting what she wants from her husband. She fills the boy with confidence; he becomes addicted to her attention and craves her warm, enveloping presence, which is what she wants. When he grows up, he is often quite ambitious, always trying to live up to the expectations of his mother. He pushes himself hard. He chooses a certain type of woman to pursue and then subtly positions her to play the mother role—to comfort, adore, and pump up his ego. In many instances, the woman will come to understand how he has manipulated her into this role, and she will resent it. She will stop being so soothing and reverential. He will blame her for changing, but in fact he is the one projecting qualities that were never exactly there and trying to make her conform to his expectations. The ensuing breakup will be very painful for the man, because he has invested energy from his earliest years and will feel this as abandonment from the mother figure. Even if he is successful in getting the woman to play the role, he himself will feel resentment at his dependency on her, the same dependency and ambivalence he had toward his mother. He may sabotage the relationship or withdraw. His anima has a sharp, recriminating edge, always ready to complain and blame. The man in this case must see the pattern of these relationships in his life. What this should signal to him is that he needs to develop from within more of the mothering qualities that he projects onto women. He must see the nature of his ambition as stemming from his desire to please his mother and live up to her expectations. He tends to drive himself too hard. He must learn to comfort and soothe himself, to withdraw from time to time and be satisfied with his accomplishments. He needs to be able to care for himself. This will drastically improve his relationships. He will give more, instead of waiting to be adored and taken care of. He will relate to women as they are, and in the end they will perhaps feel unconsciously impelled to provide more of the comfort he needs, without being pushed into this.

For those with the aggressive, masculine inclination, balance would come from training yourself to step back before taking any action. Consider the possibility that it is better to wait and see how things play out, or even to not respond at all. Taking action without proper consideration reveals weakness and a lack of self-control. For balance, always try to consider the interdependent relationships you are involved in and how each group or individual will be affected by any action. If you find yourself blocked in your career later in life, you must learn the power of withdrawing and reflecting on who you are, your needs, your strengths and weaknesses, your true interests before making any important decisions. This could require weeks or months of introspection. Some of the greatest leaders in history honed their best ideas while in prison. As the French would say, reculer pour mieux sauter (“step back in order to leap forward”).

Masculine and feminine styles of self-assessment and learning: As studies have shown, when men make mistakes they tend to look outward and find other people or circumstances to blame. Men’s sense of self is deeply tied to their success, and they do not like to look inward if they fail. This makes it difficult to learn from failures. On the other hand, men will tend to feel that they are completely responsible for any success in life. This will make them blind to the element of luck and the help of others, which will feed their grandiose tendencies (see chapter 11 for more on this). Similarly, if there is a problem, the masculine style is to try to figure it out on one’s own—to ask for assistance would be an admission of weakness. In general, men will overestimate their abilities and display confidence in their skills that are often not warranted by circumstances.

For those with the masculine style, when it comes to learning and improving yourself, it is best to reverse the order—to look inward when you make mistakes and to look outward when you have success. You will be able to benefit from experience by dropping the feeling that your ego is so tied to the success of each action or decision you make. Develop this reversal as a habit. Don’t be afraid of asking for help or feedback; instead, make this a habit as well. Weakness comes from the inability to ask questions and to learn. Lower your self-opinion. You are not as great or skilled as you imagine. This will spur you to actually improve yourself.

Finally, look at it this way: We are compelled by nature to want to move closer to what is feminine or masculine, in the form of an attraction to another person. But if we are wise, we realize we are equally compelled to do so inwardly. For centuries men have looked to women as muses, sources of inspiration. The truth is that the muse, for both genders, lies within. Moving closer to your anima or animus will bring you closer to your unconscious, which contains untapped creative treasures. The fascination you feel in relation to the feminine or masculine in others you will now feel in relation to your work, to your own thought process, and to life in general. Just as with shamans, that inner wife or husband will become the source of uncanny powers.

Sometimes they can become entrepreneurs, people who found a company because of their charisma and ability to attract followers. They can have creative flair as well. But for many of these leader types, eventually their own inner instability and chaos will come to be mirrored in the company or group they lead. They cannot forge a coherent structure or organization. Everything must flow through them. They have to control everything and everyone, their self-objects. They will proclaim this as a virtue—as being authentic and spontaneous—when really they lack the ability to focus and create something solid. They tend to burn and destroy whatever they create.

If you come in apologetically -- unsure of yourself and looking for validation from people to let you know that you're okay -- then you are likely to get dismissed. If you act like an annoying fly buzzing around, then it's only a matter of time before people swat you away. If you come in with a strong presence, sure of your actions, and present yourself in a way that deserves attention, then it will be nearly impossible for people to brush you away.

Women, and men for that matter, don't want someone who tries to make himself the center of attention. Sure, we may be entertained by that person for a while but ultimately we're most attracted to individuals who can make the moment between us the center of attention. Women don't want you to hog the spotlight. Rather, they want to share it to create an intimate experience where times flies, and you just have the best time talking about nothing in particular. They don't want someone stressed over making everything perfect for her. What they want is someone enjoying their company just as much as they are enjoying yours.

I call this child-like form of listening “emotional listening” -- listening so completely that your first reaction is simply the expression of the emotion raised in the moment. When a woman is talking about her dog that died when she was a kid, you should look and feel as though your dog just died that second. When you find out that it's her friend's birthday, you should look and feel as though it's your birthday. When she tells you about a recent accomplishment, you should look and feel like you just accomplished the goal you're currently working to achieve.

Also, when you stop worrying about what to say, take that pressure off yourself, and just listen like a child, you’ll find you are enjoying these interactions the way you always wanted to in the first place. That's really the biggest difference between a man who stands out and one who gets tossed back with the majority: are you in the moment, genuinely enjoying the company of the people around you or are you worried about what you should say? People feel great around the first person and nervous around the second.

I often say near death experiences are good things because they light a fire under people’s asses.  They remind people they could be snuffed out at any second and the life they have lived up to that point is (usually) a sad and pitiful one.  They make people take inventory of how they’ve led their life in the past and whether they wish to continue to do so into the future.   Do they want to continue leading their craptastically boring lives, watching Jerry Springer, getting drunk at the bar, listening to lousy rap, being overweight, and watching sports on TV?  Or do they want to achieve something unique, interesting, and different?  Do they want a life of happiness, joy and accomplishment, or one of misery, boredom, and commonness?  Fitness and health, or obesity and bad sex?

Sadly confidence cannot be faked.  It needs to be genuine.  You need to have confidence in yourself and conviction in everything you do.  There can be no hesitation on your part or fear of failure.  You need to approach a girl at a bar who is nestled within a herd of her female friends.  You need to ask the girl out without a care or concern she might say no.  And (my personal favorite technique) you don’t ask the women for permission to take her on a date like some simpering wimp, but tell her, “I’m taking you out on Friday.”  The key is to realize that failure is the necessary first step to success.  You will fail.  There is no avoiding it.  Matter of fact, you should embrace it.  Once you get over that and accept it, you will have confidence.  Charm/Intelligence – It is very simple – women love to laugh.  You need to be able to tickle their fancy, flirt with them, keep them smiling, and keep them on a dopamine high, all of which requires intelligence, wit, charm, and charisma.  However, when you demonstrate intelligence, wit, charm, and charisma understand you are not only entertaining them, endearing them to you more, but demonstrating you can think quickly on your feet and observe things others can’t.  All of which merely parlays into more security, more safety, and more wealth for them.  It’s why “The World’s Most Interesting Man” has more women surrounding him than the big, dumb jock who can throw a ball “real good.” Just like confidence, however, you cannot simply “flip a switch” and start being witty and charming.  It will take time and maturity.  But you can accelerate the process by reading philosophy, watching brilliant comedians like Victor Borge and Eddie Izzard, and studying the likes of Sean Connery, Cary Grant, and Walter Matthau.  This isn’t to say you will become James Bond by the age of 25, but you will certainly be more charming

“Single Member” LLC – The most likely legal entity entrepreneurs will use is the “single member LLC.”  LLC stands for “Limited Liability Company” and “single member” merely implies there is only one owner.  Because it is a “limited liability” entity, it means only the entity or company can be sued or go bankrupt and not the individual who owns it.  This allows the entrepreneur to carry out his business, pay himself money out of the LLC, and leave the LLC as merely a separate legal entity to conduct business with (or take the brunt of legal and financial problems, thereby protecting his personal assets).  Also, in this LLC being a single member LLC, the owner only needs to fill out a “Schedule C” on his taxes.  It is generally wise counsel to form a single member LLC instead of just operating as a sole proprietor.

There is a subtle art to not giving a fuck. And though the concept may sound ridiculous and I may sound like an asshole, what I’m talking about here is essentially learning how to focus and prioritize your thoughts effectively—how to pick and choose what matters to you and what does not matter to you based on finely honed personal values. This is incredibly difficult. It takes a lifetime of practice and discipline to achieve. And you will regularly fail. But it is perhaps the most worthy struggle one can undertake in one’s life. It is perhaps the only struggle in one’s life.

This is what is so admirable. No, not me, dumbass—the overcoming adversity stuff, the willingness to be different, an outcast, a pariah, all for the sake of one’s own values. The willingness to stare failure in the face and shove your middle finger back at it. The people who don’t give a fuck about adversity or failure or embarrassing themselves or shitting the bed a few times. The people who just laugh and then do what they believe in anyway. Because they know it’s right. They know it’s more important than they are, more important than their own feelings and their own pride and their own ego. They say, “Fuck it,” not to everything in life, but rather to everything unimportant in life. They reserve their fucks for what truly matters. Friends. Family. Purpose. Burritos. And an occasional lawsuit or two. And because of that, because they reserve their fucks for only the big things that matter, people give a fuck about them in return.

Essentially, we become more selective about the fucks we’re willing to give. This is something called maturity. It’s nice; you should try it sometime. Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy. As Bunk Moreland said to his partner Detective McNulty in The Wire (which, fuck you, I still downloaded): “That’s what you get for giving a fuck when it wasn’t your turn to give a fuck.”

And, in a strange way, this is liberating. We no longer need to give a fuck about everything. Life is just what it is. We accept it, warts and all. We realize that we’re never going to cure cancer or go to the moon or feel Jennifer Aniston’s tits. And that’s okay. Life goes on. We now reserve our ever-dwindling fucks for the most truly fuck-worthy parts of our lives: our families, our best friends, our golf swing. And, to our astonishment, this is enough. This simplification actually makes us really fucking happy on a consistent basis. And we start to think, Maybe that crazy alcoholic Bukowski was onto something. Don’t try.

I see practical enlightenment as becoming comfortable with the idea that some suffering is always inevitable—that no matter what you do, life is comprised of failures, loss, regrets, and even death. Because once you become comfortable with all the shit that life throws at you (and it will throw a lot of shit, trust me), you become invincible in a sort of low-level spiritual way. After all, the only way to overcome pain is to first learn how to bear it.

For most of my adolescence and young adulthood, I fantasized about being a musician—a rock star, in particular. Any badass guitar song I heard, I would always close my eyes and envision myself up on stage, playing it to the screams of the crowd, people absolutely losing their minds to my sweet finger-noodling glory. This fantasy could keep me occupied for hours on end. For me, it was never a question of if I’d ever be up playing in front of screaming crowds, but when. I had it all planned out. I was simply biding my time before I could invest the proper amount of energy and effort into getting out there and making my mark. First I needed to finish school. Then I needed to make some extra money to buy gear. Then I needed to find enough free time to practice. Then I had to network and plan my first project. Then . . . and then nothing. Despite my fantasizing about this for over half my lifetime, the reality never came to fruition. And it took me a long time and a lot of struggle to finally figure out why: I didn’t actually want it. I was in love with the result—the image of me on stage, people cheering, me rocking out, pouring my heart into what I was playing—but I wasn’t in love with the process. And because of that, I failed at it. Repeatedly. Hell, I didn’t even try hard enough to fail at it. I hardly tried at all. The daily drudgery of practicing, the logistics of finding a group and rehearsing, the pain of finding gigs and actually getting people to show up and give a shit, the broken strings, the blown tube amp, hauling forty pounds of gear to and from rehearsals with no car. It’s a mountain of a dream and a mile-high climb to the top. And what it took me a long time to discover is that I didn’t like to climb much. I just liked to imagine the summit.

What is objectively true about your situation is not as important as how you come to see the situation, how you choose to measure it and value it. Problems may be inevitable, but the meaning of each problem is not. We get to control what our problems mean based on how we choose to think about them, the standard by which we choose to measure

We’re apes. We think we’re all sophisticated with our toaster ovens and designer footwear, but we’re just a bunch of finely ornamented apes. And because we are apes, we instinctually measure ourselves against others and vie for status. The question is not whether we evaluate ourselves against others; rather, the question is by what standard do we measure ourselves?

The rest of this book is dedicated to five counterintuitive values that I believe are the most beneficial values one can adopt. All follow the “backwards law” we talked about earlier, in that they’re “negative.” All require confronting deeper problems rather than avoiding them through highs. These five values are both unconventional and uncomfortable. But, to me, they are life-changing. The first, which we’ll look at in the next chapter, is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who’s at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgement of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure: the willingness to discover your own flaws and mistakes so that they may be improved upon. The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no, thus clearly defining what you will and will not accept in your life. The final value is the contemplation of one’s own mortality; this one is crucial, because paying vigilant attention to one’s own death is perhaps the only thing capable of helping us keep all our other values in proper perspective.

The goal is to get the kids to recognize that their values are not rational—that in fact their values are not even theirs, but rather are the disorder’s—and that by fulfilling these irrational values they are actually harming their ability to function in life. The next step is to encourage the kids to choose a value that is more important than their OCD value and to focus on that.

Instead of striving for certainty, we should be in constant search of doubt: doubt about our own beliefs, doubt about our own feelings, doubt about what the future may hold for us unless we get out there and create it for ourselves. Instead of looking to be right all the time, we should be looking for how we’re wrong all the time. Because we are.

And it’s in these moments of insecurity, of deep despair, that we become susceptible to an insidious entitlement: believing that we deserve to cheat a little to get our way, that other people deserve to be punished, that we deserve to take what we want, and sometimes violently. It’s the backwards law again: the more you try to be certain about something, the more uncertain and insecure you will feel. But the converse is true as well: the more you embrace being uncertain and not knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you don’t know. Uncertainty removes our judgments of others; it preempts the unnecessary stereotyping and biases that we otherwise feel when we see somebody on TV, in the office, or on the street. Uncertainty also relieves us of our judgment of ourselves. We don’t know if we’re lovable or not; we don’t know how attractive we are; we don’t know how successful we could potentially become. The only way to achieve these things is to remain uncertain of them and be open to finding them out through experience.

In this way, “knowing yourself” or “finding yourself” can be dangerous. It can cement you into a strict role and saddle you with unnecessary expectations. It can close you off to inner potential and outer opportunities. I say don’t find yourself. I say never know who you are. Because that’s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others.

For certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom; when the passions relax their hold, then, as Sophocles says, we are freed from the grasp not of one mad master only, but of many. The truth is, Socrates, that these regrets, and also the complaints about relations, are to be attributed to the same cause, which is not old age, but men's characters and tempers; for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are equally a burden.

That was why I asked you the question, I replied, because I see that you are indifferent about money, which is a characteristic rather of those who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired them; the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation of their own, resembling the affection of authors for their own poems, or of parents for their children, besides that natural love of it for the sake of use and profit which is common to them and all men. And hence they are very bad company, for they can talk about nothing but the praises of wealth.

Travel is a fantastic self-development tool, because it extricates you from the values of your culture and shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function and not hate themselves. This exposure to different cultural values and metrics then forces you to reexamine what seems obvious in your own life and to consider that perhaps it’s not necessarily the best way to live. In this case, Russia had me reexamining the bullshitty, fake-nice communication that is so common in Anglo culture, and asking myself if this wasn’t somehow making us more insecure around each other and worse at intimacy.

You should have known that and canceled your plans.” Or they take on too much responsibility for other people’s problems: “She just lost her job again, but it’s probably my fault because I wasn’t as supportive of her as I could have been.

I use the example of cheating in a romantic relationship, but this process applies to a breach in any relationship. When trust is destroyed, it can be rebuilt only if the following two steps happen: 1) the trust-breaker admits the true values that caused the breach and owns up to them, and 2) the trust-breaker builds a solid track record of improved behavior over time. Without the first step, there should be no attempt at reconciliation in the first place.

We are actually often happier with less. When we’re overloaded with opportunities and options, we suffer from what psychologists refer to as the paradox of choice.

Death scares us. And because it scares us, we avoid thinking about it, talking about it, sometimes even acknowledging it, even when it’s happening to someone close to us.

The Denial of Death essentially makes two points: 1.    Humans are unique in that we’re the only animals that can conceptualize and think about ourselves abstractly. Dogs don’t sit around and worry about their career. Cats don’t think about their past mistakes or wonder what would have happened if they’d done something differently. Monkeys don’t argue over future possibilities, just as fish don’t sit around wondering if other fish would like them more if they had longer fins. As humans, we’re blessed with the ability to imagine ourselves in hypothetical situations, to contemplate both the past and the future, to imagine other realities or situations where things might be different. And it’s because of this unique mental ability, Becker says, that we all, at some point, become aware of the inevitability of our own death. Because we’re able to conceptualize alternate versions of reality, we are also the only animal capable of imagining a reality without ourselves in it. This realization causes what Becker calls “death terror,” a deep existential anxiety that underlies everything we think or do. 2.   Becker’s second point starts with the premise that we essentially have two “selves.” The first self is the physical self—the one that eats, sleeps, snores, and poops. The second self is our conceptual self—our identity, or how we see ourselves. Becker’s argument is this: We are all aware on some level that our physical self will eventually die, that this death is inevitable, and that its inevitability—on some unconscious level—scares the shit out of us. Therefore, in order to compensate for our fear of the inevitable loss of our physical self, we try to construct a conceptual self that will live forever. This is why people try so hard to put their names on buildings, on statues, on spines of books. It’s why we feel compelled to spend so much time giving ourselves to others, especially to children, in the hopes that our influence—our conceptual self—will last way beyond our physical self. That we will be remembered and revered and idolized long after our physical self ceases to exist. Becker called such efforts our “immortality projects,” projects that allow our conceptual self to live on way past the point of our physical death. All of human civilization, he says, is basically a result of immortality projects: the cities and governments and structures and authorities in place today were all immortality projects of men and women who came before us. They are the remnants of conceptual selves that ceased to die. Names like Jesus, Muhammad, Napoleon, and Shakespeare are just as powerful today as when those men lived, if not more so. And that’s the whole point. Whether it be through mastering an art form, conquering a new land, gaining great riches, or simply having a large and loving family that will live on for generations, all the meaning in our life is shaped by this innate desire to never truly die.

What Becker is saying, in essence, is that we’re all driven by fear to give way too many fucks about something, because giving a fuck about something is the only thing that distracts us from the reality and inevitability of our own death. And to truly not give a single fuck is to achieve a quasi-spiritual state of embracing the impermanence of one’s own existence. In that state, one is far less likely to get caught up in various forms of entitlement.

Confronting the reality of our own mortality is important because it obliterates all the crappy, fragile, superficial values in life. While most people whittle their days chasing another buck, or a little bit more fame and attention, or a little bit more assurance that they’re right or loved, death confronts all of us with a far more painful and important question: What is your legacy?

And when we avoid this question, we let trivial and hateful values hijack our brains and take control of our desires and ambitions. Without acknowledging the ever-present gaze of death, the superficial will appear important, and the important will appear superficial. Death is the only thing we can know with any certainty.

Without acknowledging the ever-present gaze of death, the superficial will appear important, and the important will appear superficial. Death is the only thing we can know with any certainty. And as such, it must be the compass by which we orient all of our other values and decisions. It is the correct answer to all of the questions we should ask but never do. The only way to be comfortable with death is to understand and see yourself as something bigger than yourself; to choose values that stretch beyond serving yourself, that are simple and immediate and controllable and tolerant of the chaotic world around you. This is the basic root of all happiness. Whether you’re listening to Aristotle or the psychologists at Harvard or Jesus Christ or the goddamn Beatles, they all say that happiness comes from the same thing: caring about something greater than yourself, believing that you are a contributing component in some much larger entity, that your life is but a mere side process of some great unintelligible production. This feeling is what people go to church for; it’s what they fight in wars for; it’s what they raise families and save pensions and build bridges and invent cell phones for: this fleeting sense of being part of something greater and more unknowable than themselves.

One day, you and everyone you love will die. And beyond a small group of people for an extremely brief period of time, little of what you say or do will ever matter. This is the Uncomfortable Truth of life. And everything you think or do is but an elaborate avoidance of it. We are inconsequential cosmic dust, bumping and milling about on a tiny blue speck. We imagine our own importance. We invent our purpose—we are nothing. Enjoy your fucking coffee.

Hopelessness is the root of anxiety, mental illness, and depression. It is the source of all misery and the cause of all addiction. This is not an overstatement.4 Chronic anxiety is a crisis of hope. It is the fear of a failed future. Depression is a crisis of hope. It is the belief in a meaningless future. Delusion, addiction, obsession—these are all the mind’s desperate and compulsive attempts at generating hope one neurotic tic or obsessive craving at a time.5

Truth. These hope narratives are then what give our lives a sense of purpose. Not only do they imply that there is something better in the future, but also that it’s actually possible to go out and achieve that something. When people prattle on about needing to find their “life’s purpose,” what they really mean is that it’s no longer clear to them what matters, what is a worthy use of their limited time here on earth6—in short, what to hope for.

That’s the hard part: finding that before/after for yourself. It’s difficult because there’s no way ever to know for sure if you’ve got it right. This is why a lot of people flock to religion, because religions acknowledge this permanent state of unknowing and demand faith in the face of it. This is also probably partly why religious people suffer from depression and commit suicide in far fewer numbers than nonreligious people: that practiced faith protects them from the Uncomfortable Truth.

Whether we realize it or not, we all have these narratives we’ve elected to buy into for whatever reason. It doesn’t matter if the way you get to hope is via religious faith or evidence-based theory or an intuition or a well-reasoned argument—they all produce the same result: you have some belief that (a) there is potential for growth or improvement or salvation in the future, and (b) there are ways we can navigate ourselves to get there.

Because you don’t get to control your feelings, Thinking Brain. Self-control is an illusion. It’s an illusion that occurs when both brains are aligned and pursuing the same course of action. It’s an illusion designed to give people hope. And when the Thinking Brain isn’t aligned with the Feeling Brain, people feel powerless, and the world around them begins to feel hopeless. The only way you consistently nail that illusion is by consistently communicating and aligning the brains around the same values.

The values we pick up throughout our lives crystallize and form a sediment on top of our personality.36 The only way to change our values is to have experiences contrary to our values. And any attempt to break free from those values through new or contrary experiences will inevitably be met with pain and discomfort.37 This is why there is no such thing as change without pain, no growth without discomfort. It’s why it is impossible to become someone new without first grieving the loss of who you used to be.

Evidence belongs to the Thinking Brain, whereas values are decided by the Feeling Brain. You cannot verify values. They are, by definition, subjective and arbitrary. Therefore, you can argue about facts until you’re blue in the face, but ultimately, it doesn’t matter—people interpret the significance of their experiences through their values.

If a meteorite hit a town and killed half the people, the über-traditional religious person would look at the event and say that it happened because the town was full of sinners. The atheist would look at it and say that it was proof there is no God (another faith-based belief, by the way), as how could a benevolent, all-powerful being let such an awful thing happen? A hedonist would look at it and decide that it was even more reason to party, since we could all die at any moment. And a capitalist would look at it and start thinking about how to invest in meteorite-defense technologies.

They, too, had seen the liberating message in Nietzsche’s work. He wrote of social structures crippling the individual; feminists argued that the social structures of the age imprisoned them. He denounced the Church for rewarding the weak and mediocre; feminists, too, denounced the Church, for forcing women into marriage and subservience to men. And he dared recast the story of human history not as mankind’s escape from and dominance over nature, but as mankind’s growing ignorance to its own nature. He argued that the individual must empower himself and access ever-higher levels of freedom and consciousness. These women saw feminism as the next step to that higher liberation.

Conversely, Nietzsche argued, the “slaves” of society would generate a moral code of their own. Whereas the masters believed they were righteous and virtuous because of their strength, the slaves of society came to believe that they were righteous and virtuous because of their weakness. Slave morality believes that people who have suffered the most, those who are the most disadvantaged and exploited, deserve the best treatment because of that suffering. Slave morality believes that it’s the poorest and most unfortunate who deserve the most sympathy and the most respect.

Whereas master morality believes in the virtue of strength and dominance, slave morality believes in the virtue of sacrifice and submission.

“God is dead” was not some obnoxious atheistic gloating, as it is usually interpreted today. No. It was a lament, a warning, a cry for help. Who are we to determine the meaning and significance of our own existence? Who are we to decide what is good and right in the world? How can we bear this burden? Nietzsche, understanding that existence is inherently chaotic and unknowable, believed that we were not psychologically equipped to handle the task of explaining our cosmic significance. He saw the spate of ideological religions that spewed forth in the Enlightenment’s wake (democracy, nationalism, communism, socialism, colonialism, etc.) as merely postponing the inevitable existential crisis of mankind. And he hated them all. He found democracy to be naïve, nationalism stupid, communism appalling, colonialism offensive.14

So far, I’ve argued that hope is fundamental to our psychology, that we need to (a) have something to look forward to, (b) believe ourselves in control of our fate enough to achieve that something, and (c) find a community to achieve it with us. When we lack one or all of these for too long, we lose hope and spiral into the void of the Uncomfortable Truth.

Nietzsche instead believed that we must look beyond hope. We must look beyond values. We must evolve into something “beyond good and evil.” For him, this morality of the future had to begin with something he called amor fati, or “love of one’s fate”: “My formula for greatness in a human being,” he wrote, “is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it—all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary—but love

10 Rules for a Rich Life 1. A Rich Life means you can spend extravagantly on the things you love as long as you cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t. 2. Focus on the Big Wins—the five to ten things that get you disproportionate results, including automating your savings and investing, finding a job you love, and negotiating your salary. Get the Big Wins right and you can order as many lattes as you want. 3. Investing should be very boring—and very profitable—over the long term. I get more excited eating tacos than checking my investment returns. 4. There’s a limit to how much you can cut, but no limit to how much you can earn. I have readers who earn $50,000/year and ones who earn $750,000/year. They both buy the same loaves of bread. Controlling spending is important, but your earnings become super-linear. 5. Your friends and family will have lots of “tips” once you begin your financial journey. Listen politely, then stick to the program. 6. Build a collection of “spending frameworks” to use when deciding on buying something. Most people default to restrictive rules (“I need to cut back on eating out . . .”), but you can flip it and decide what you’ll always spend on, like my book-buying rule: If you’re thinking about buying a book, just buy it. Don’t waste even five seconds debating it. Applying even one new idea from a book is worth it. (Like this one.) 7. Beware of the endless search for “advanced” tips. So many people seek out high-level answers to avoid the real, hard work of improving step by step. It’s easier to dream about winning the Boston Marathon than to go out for a ten-minute jog every morning. Sometimes the most advanced thing you can do is the basics, consistently. 8. You’re in control. This isn’t a Disney movie and nobody’s coming to rescue you. Fortunately, you can take control of your finances and build your Rich Life. 9. Part of creating your Rich Life is the willingness to be unapologetically different. Once money isn’t a primary constraint, you’ll have the freedom to design your own Rich Life, which will almost certainly be different from the average person’s. Embrace it. This is the fun part! 10. Live life outside the spreadsheet. Once you automate your money using the system in this book, you’ll see that the most important part of a Rich Life is outside the spreadsheet—it involves relationships, new experiences, and giving back. You earned it.

Now the one tricky part: If you decide to get a new card, should you close your old card? I’ve changed my view here over the years. The typical advice is to keep cards open for as long as possible, which is generally smart. But if you have lots of cards that you never use, reconsider this. Some of my readers have opened over twenty-plus cards to “churn” rewards, and now they can’t keep track of all their cards. This is where you have to make a decision on risk versus reward and simplicity versus complexity. There’s lots of advice warning against closing credit cards, but as long as you’re paying your balances on time and have good credit, closing an old card will not have a major long-term impact on your credit score. Think balance: For most people, having two or three credit cards is perfect. If you have a special reason to have more cards—for example, if you own a business or are intentionally maximizing temporary sign-up rewards—great. But if you find yourself swamped with the number of cards you have, close the inactive ones. As long as you have good credit, the long-term impact will be minimal and you’ll sleep easier at night with a simple financial system you can easily keep track of.

What to Do If You Miss a Payment Nobody’s perfect. Despite my warnings, I understand that accidents happen and you might miss a payment at some point. When this happens, I use my Indian heritage to beat the companies by negotiating with them, and you can, too: You: Hi, I noticed I missed a payment, and I wanted to confirm that this won’t affect my credit score. Credit card rep: Let me check on that. No, the late fee will be applied, but it won’t affect your credit score. (Note: If you pay within a few days of your missed bill, it usually won’t be reported to the credit agencies. But ask to be sure.) You: Thank you! I’m really happy to hear that. Now, about that fee . . . I understand I was late, but I’d like to have it waived. Credit card rep: Why? You: It was a mistake. It won’t happen again, so I’d like to have the fee removed. (Note: Always end your sentence with strength. Don’t say, “Can you remove this?” Say, “I’d like to have this removed.”) At this point, you have a better-than-50-percent chance of getting the fee credited to your account. But just in case you get an especially tough rep, try this. Credit card rep: I’m very sorry, but we can’t refund that fee. I can try to get you our latest blah blah marketing pitch blah blah . . . You: I’m sorry, but I’ve been a customer for four years and I’d hate for this one fee to drive me away from your service. What can you do to remove the late fee? Credit card rep: Hmm . . . Let me check on that . . . Yes, I was able to remove the fee this time. It’s been credited to your account. You don’t believe me that it can be so simple? It is. Anyone can do it.

Credit card rep: Why are you requesting a credit increase? You: I’ve been paying my bill in full for the last eighteen months and I have some upcoming purchases. I’d like a credit limit of ten thousand dollars. Can you approve my request? Rep: Sure. I’ve put in a request for this increase. It should be activated in about seven days.

Automatic warranty doubling: Most cards extend the warranty on your purchases. So if you buy an iPhone and it breaks after Apple’s warranty expires, your credit card will still cover it up to an additional year. This is true for nearly every credit card for nearly every purchase, automatically. ■ Car rental insurance: If you rent a car, don’t let them sell you on getting the extra collision insurance. It’s completely worthless! You already have coverage through your existing car insurance, plus your credit card will usually back you up to $50,000. ■ Trip-cancellation insurance: If you book tickets for a vacation and then get sick and can’t travel, your airline will charge you hefty fees to rebook your ticket. Just call your credit card and ask for the trip-cancellation insurance to kick in, and they’ll cover those change fees—usually between $3,000 to $10,000 per trip. ■ Concierge services: When I couldn’t find LA Philharmonic tickets, I called my credit card and asked the concierge to try to find some. He called me back in two days with tickets. They charged me (a lot, actually), but he was able to get them when nobody else could. Most important, your credit card automatically tracks your spending, making it easy for software to download and categorize your expenses.

action steps week ONE 1 Get your credit score and credit report (one hour). Check them to make sure there are no errors and to get familiar with your credit. You can access your report and score at myfico.com. (As I mentioned, lots of people use Credit Karma to get a free credit score, but I prefer the official credit score from MyFico, which is more accurate even though it has a small fee.) In addition to your credit score, get your free credit report from annualcreditreport.com. 2 Set up your credit card (two hours). If you already have one, call and make sure it’s a no-fee card. If you want to get a new credit card, check out bankrate.com to find the best one for you.  3 Make sure you’re handling your credit cards effectively (three hours). Set up automatic payments so your credit card bill is paid off in full every month. (If you’re in debt, set up an automatic payment for the largest amount you can afford.) Get your fees waived. Apply for more credit, if you’re debt-free. Make sure you’re getting the most out of your cards. 4 If you have debt, start paying it off (one week to plan, then start paying more). Not tomorrow, not next week, today: Give yourself one week to figure out how much you owe, call the lender to negotiate down the APR or restructure your payments (in the case of student loans), and set up your automatic payment with more money than you’re paying now. Getting out of debt quickly will be the best financial decision you ever make.

When They Say “We Don’t Have No-Fee Accounts” Say you realize your current checking account charges you fees and you want to switch. When you call, they tell you they can’t offer a no-fee account. Are you going to accept that? Hell no. Go on offense. Here’s what to say. You: Hi. I noticed that my current checking account has fees. I’d like my account to have no annual fees, free checking, and no minimum balance, please. Bank rep: I’m really sorry, but we don’t offer that kind of account anymore. You: Really? That’s interesting, because [competitor] is offering me that exact deal right now. Could you check again and tell me which comparable accounts you offer? (Eighty percent of the time, you’ll get a great account at this point. If not, ask for a supervisor.) Supervisor: Hi, how can I help you? You: (Repeat argument from the beginning. If the supervisor doesn’t give you an option, add this:) Look, I’ve been a customer for X years, and I want to find a way to make this work. Plus, I know that your customer-acquisition cost runs hundreds of dollars. What can you do to help me stay a customer? Supervisor: What an astounding coincidence. My computer is suddenly allowing me to offer the exact account you asked for! You: Why, thank you, kind sir. (Sip Darjeeling tea.) The bank has already spent a lot of money to land you as a customer and doesn’t want to lose you over something as small as a $5 monthly fee. Use this knowledge as leverage whenever you contact any financial company.

Think of savings accounts as places for short-term (one month) to mid-term savings (five years). You want to use your savings account to save up for things like vacations and holiday gifts, or even longer-term items, like a wedding or the down payment on a house. The key difference between checking and savings accounts is this: Savings accounts technically pay more interest. I say “technically” because on a practical level, the interest on your savings account is essentially meaningless.

How My Bank Accounts Work Here are the accounts I use and how I’ve set them up to work together. My Accounts. All of my money goes through my interest-bearing Schwab online checking account. Deposits happen through direct deposit or by taking a photo of a check and depositing it through the Schwab app. My System. My finances work on a monthly cycle, and my system automatically disburses money where it needs to go. I’ve set up accounts to draw from my checking account. For example, my Capital One 360 savings account automatically withdraws a certain amount every month from my checking account, as does my investment account (more about these in Chapter 3). For rewards, tracking, and consumer protection, I pay my bills using my credit card. The credit card is automatically paid in full every month by my online checking account. For cash expenses, I use the Schwab ATM card to withdraw money at any ATM nationwide. All ATM charges are automatically reimbursed at the end of the month. Generally, I use my Capital One 360 account as a receiver, not a sender: I rarely transfer money out of there unless I need to cover a temporary shortage in my checking account or want to spend savings money on something important, like a vacation . . . And that’s how I do it.

action steps week two 1 Open a checking account or assess the one you already have (one hour). Find an account that works for you, call the bank (or go in), and open the account. If you’ve already got one, make absolutely sure it is a no-fee, no-minimum account. How? Open up your last bank statement or, if you don’t have that, call your bank and say, “I’d like to confirm that my bank account has no fees and no minimums whatsoever. Can you confirm that?” If you discover you’ve been paying fees, use the negotiating tactic to get your account switched to a no-fee, no-minimum account. Be aggressive in threatening to leave if they don’t switch you. 2 Open an online high-interest savings account (three hours). You’ll earn higher interest, and it’s psychologically powerful to have your savings account separate from your checking: You’ll be much less likely to dip into your savings if it's not immediately reachable through your normal banking. Spend a couple of hours looking over the banks I recommended. To see a more comprehensive list, compare banks at bankrate.com or check my website to see what my blog readers think of different bank accounts. 2a Optional: Open an online checking account (two hours). This isn’t absolutely necessary, but if you’re ready to be more advanced about your checking and earn a higher interest rate, go ahead and open up an online checking account. Remember, the main benefits of an online checking account are a high interest rate and fewer tricky fees. If you don’t love your checking account, switch! It doesn’t take that long, and having the right checking account means the rest of your financial system will run smoothly for years to come. 3 Fund your online savings account (one hour). Leave one and a half months of living expenses in your checking account, or as close to it as you can manage. (The little extra prevents overdrafts as you’re getting used to transferring money between accounts. Remember, most transfers take a day or two.) Transfer the rest to your savings account—even if it’s only $30.

I belabor this headache-inducing explanation of relativity because I believe a similar thing is going on within our own psychology: what we believe is the universal constant of our experience is, in fact, not constant at all. And, instead, much of what we assume to be true and real is relative to our own perception.

This fascinated researchers. Nobody is fully happy all the time, but similarly, nobody is fully unhappy all the time, either. It seems that humans, regardless of our external circumstances, live in a constant state of mild-but-not-fully-satisfying happiness.

But this is not true—in fact, this is backward. Pain is the universal constant of life. And human perception and expectations warp themselves to fit a predetermined amount of pain. In other words, no matter how sunny our skies get, our mind will always imagine just enough clouds to be slightly disappointed.

This constancy of pain results in what is known as “the hedonic treadmill,” upon which you run and run and run, chasing your imagined ten. But, no matter what, you always end up with a seven. The pain is always there. What changes is your perception of it. And as soon as your life “improves,” your expectations shift, and you’re back to being mildly dissatisfied again.

Because you can’t get rid of pain—pain is the universal constant of the human condition. Therefore, the attempt to move away from pain, to protect oneself from all harm, can only backfire. Trying to eliminate pain only increases your sensitivity to suffering, rather than alleviating your suffering. It causes you to see dangerous ghosts in every nook, to see tyranny and oppression in every authority, to see hate and deceit behind every embrace.

This is because pain is the experience of life itself. Positive emotions are the temporary removal of pain; negative emotions the temporary augmentation of it. To numb one’s pain is to numb all feeling, all emotion. It is to quietly remove oneself from living.

The Buddha said that suffering is like being shot by two arrows. The first arrow is the physical pain—it’s the metal piercing the skin, the force colliding into the body. The second arrow is the mental pain, the meaning and emotion we attach to the being struck, the narratives that we spin in our minds about whether we deserved or didn’t deserve what happened. In many cases, our mental pain is far worse than any physical pain. In most cases, it lasts far longer.

The question of whether MMA is too violent ultimately comes down to definitions. Violence, to me, suggests an altercation in which one party doesn’t actually want to be involved. I don’t understand how that word can be used to describe a sporting contest – whether it’s MMA, boxing or something else – in which two consenting adults are participating willingly. In fact, I believe it’s quite an honourable thing for two individuals to agree to compete against one another under a specified set of rules, on a particular date, at an agreed weight, officiated by a referee and judges.

Trucks are marketed to men as ways to assert strength and reliability. Makeup is marketed to women as a way to be more loved and garner more attention. Beer is marketed as a way to have fun and be the center of attention at a party.

Slow-burning carbohydrates such as vegetables aren’t much good. Eat what you can’t eat while cutting weight, basically.

Pook nodded. “These are but a few of the Harsh Truths: Women would rather share a successful man than be attached to a faithful loser. Many women do not marry for love. Most divorces end up with the guy cherishing the woman but the woman detesting the man. Even for long-term marriage, the Don Juan is the way to go. The ‘innocent, nice girl’ is often the horniest and likely uninnocent. Many women consider your looks, your career, what you can offer them, before your integrity and character. Women are more sexual than men can even dream. Women are not attracted to genius, only strength and imagination Woman’s sole mission is union, either for pleasure or the fruits of children. She cares nothing for your philosophy and all except to either use it to catch interest in a guy or to enthrone herself. Women, in sex, desire to be treated as an object and relish it.

Maybe you know a guy who picks up a lot of girls. You can see it as soon as you look at him. As soon as he rolls into a room, he just oozes coolness and high value. He doesn’t react emotionally to anything a girl might throw at him. And, this behavior is highly effective at getting girls into bed. (In fact, I recommend being emotionally unreactive to a degree in order to pick up girls.)

Combine spanking with dirty talk to make it even more powerful. Tell her “You’re a bad little girl, and bad little girls have to get punished” as you spank her. If she’s more comfortable with you, kick the dirty talk up a notch. Say something like “you’re a dirty little slut, you’ve been thinking about getting fucked all day. Look at how wet your pussy is…you need to be punished for being such a whore.”

When she’s very aroused, tell her that you know how much she thinks about sex. Say that she pretends she doesn’t want to get fucked all day, but you know what a slut she is on the inside. Tell her you know that she thinks about your cock inside her all day. She’ll protest and give you a token “no…I’m a good girl…” but don’t pay attention. Tell her that her pussy gets wet when she even thinks about your cock inside her. Tell her how wet she is right now, she’s dripping all over your cock.

This is common in guys who were formerly rejected frequently by women, but improved their social skills. The fear of rejection they inherited from their past of social failure carries over to the present. This causes them to put up emotional walls around themselves. Their self-destructive behavior sabotages their sex lives and relationships.

If a woman has experienced good sex with you, she will start to develop emotions towards you. She hides and represses these emotions, fearing that they will scare you or cause her to be hurt. To unleash the power of these emotions, let her know that they are uncontrollable and that you are eminently conscious of them.

Finally, once you’ve gotten all your expenses filled in, add 15 percent for expenditures you haven’t counted yet. Yes, really. For example, you probably didn’t capture “car repair,” which can cost $400 each time (that’s $33/month). Or dry cleaning or emergency medical care or charitable donations. A flat 15 percent will likely cover you for things you haven’t figured in, and you can get more accurate as time goes on.

Long-Term Investments This bucket includes the amount you’ll send to your 401(k) and Roth IRA each month. A good rule of thumb is to invest 10 percent of your take-home pay (after taxes, or the amount on your monthly paycheck) for the long term. Your 401(k) contributions count toward the 10 percent, so if you already participate in a 401(k), you’ll need to add that amount to your take-home money to get a total monthly salary.

“The 60 Percent Solution,” which suggested that you split your money into simple buckets, with the largest, basic expenses (food, bills, taxes), making up 60 percent of your gross income. The remaining 40 percent would be split four ways: 1. Retirement savings (10 percent) 2. Long-term savings (10 percent) 3. Short-term savings for irregular expenses (10 percent) 4. Fun money (10 percent) The article has been widely distributed, although curiously, none of my friends had heard of it. My Conscious Spending Plan relates to Jenkins’s 60 Percent Solution, but it’s more focused toward young people. We spend a huge amount on eating out and going out, whereas our housing costs are lower because we can share apartments and rent more comfortably than older people with families.

action steps week four 1 Get your paycheck, determine what you’ve been spending, and figure out what your Conscious Spending Plan should look like (thirty minutes). Do this now and don’t overthink it. Just break your take-home income into chunks of fixed costs (50–60 percent), long-term investments (10 percent), savings goals (5–10 percent), and guilt-free spending money (20–35 percent). How does it fit? 2 Optimize your spending (two hours). Dig deeper into your savings goals and monthly fixed costs. Try the À La Carte Method. How much does your insurance actually cost—can you improve on that? How much will you spend for Christmas gifts and vacation this year? Break these expenses down into monthly chunks, then recalculate your plan. 3 Pick your Big Wins (five hours). Open an account at You Need a Budget or Personal Capital. Assuming you want to cut your spending by $200/month, what one or two Big Wins will you target? Start using the envelope system. 4 Maintain your Conscious Spending Plan (one hour per week). Enter any cash receipts into your system each week. Tweak the percentages you send to each part of your spending plan (we’ll cover this in detail in the next chapter). And most important, make sure your system is realistic enough that you’ll stick with it for the long term.

To see how it works, let’s use my friend Michelle as an example: Michelle gets paid once a month. Her employer automatically deducts 5 percent of her pay—an amount she set up by talking to her HR department—and puts it in her 401(k). The rest of Michelle’s paycheck goes to her checking account by direct deposit. (For simplicity, I’m not including taxes here, but you can control how much your employer withholds from each paycheck to pay taxes by speaking to your HR department.)

(For simplicity, I’m not including taxes here, but you can control how much your employer withholds from each paycheck to pay taxes by speaking to your HR department.) About a day later, her Automatic Money Flow begins transferring money out of her checking account. Her Roth IRA retirement account will pull 5 percent of her salary for itself. (That combines with the 401(k) contribution to complete the 10 percent of take-home pay for investing.) One percent will go to a wedding sub-savings account, 2 percent to a house down-payment sub-savings account, and 2 percent is earmarked for her emergency fund. (That takes care of her monthly savings goals, with a total of 5 percent of take-home pay going into savings.)

Some of her bills can’t be put on credit cards—for example, utilities and loans—so they’re automatically paid out of her checking account. Finally, her credit card company automatically emails her a copy of her bill for a 5-minute review. After she’s reviewed it, the bill is also automatically paid in full from her checking account. The money that remains in her account is used for guilt-free spending money.

To make sure she doesn’t overspend, she’s focused on two Big Wins: eating out and new clothes. She sets alerts in You Need a Budget (YNAB) to notify her if she goes over her spending goals, and she keeps a reserve of $500 in her checking account just in case. (The couple of times she went over her spending, she paid herself back using her “unexpected expenses” money from her savings account.) To track spending more easily, she uses her credit card to pay for all of her fun stuff as often as possible. She knows from her spending trend that she tends to spend $100 a month in cash on coffee and tips, so she includes that in her guilt-free spending. No tracking receipts or manually entering data. In the middle of the month, Michelle’s calendar reminds her to check her financial software to make sure she’s within her limits for her spending money. If she’s doing fine, she gets on with her life. If she’s over her limit, she decides what she needs to cut back on to stay on track for the month. Luckily, she has fifteen days to get it right, and by politely passing on an invitation to eat out she gets back on track.

By the way, while you’re logged in to your credit card account, also set up an email notification (this is typically under “Notifications” or “Bills”) to send you a monthly link to your bill, so you can review it before the money is automatically transferred out of your checking account. This is helpful in case your bill unexpectedly exceeds the amount available in your checking account—that way you can adjust the amount you pay that month.

If you’re paid twice a month: Replicate the above system on the first and the fifteenth—with half the money each time. The key is to make sure you pay your bills on time, which is why it’s important to move your bills’ due dates to the first of the month. Now—to oversimplify it for explanation’s sake—you’ll pay your bills with your first paycheck of the month, and you’ll fund your savings and investing accounts with your second paycheck of the month. I’ve also got two other options for you to use this system if you’re paid twice a month: ■ Another way to work your system is to do half the payments with one paycheck (retirement, fixed costs) and half the payments with the second paycheck (savings, guilt-free spending), but that can get clunky. ■ Save a “buffer” of money, which you can use to simulate getting paid once a month. You’re essentially using a pool of money to pay your bills and contribute to your savings and checking account, then getting “paid back” by your paycheck each month. For example, if your take-home pay is $4,000/month (or $2,000 bimonthly), you could keep $6,000 in your checking account and follow my automation system as outlined in this chapter. Why $6,000? Because each month, your automation system will begin transferring money for bills and savings and checking, and you want to build in a little extra in case something goes wrong (such as your paycheck arriving late). If you can afford to do this, this is a great way to simplify your system and simulate getting paid once a month—even if you get paid bimonthly.

So ignore the pundits’ predictions. Ignore once-in-a-lifetime freakish results. And ignore the last year or two of a fund’s performance—a fund manager may be able to perform very well over the short term. But over the long term that manager will almost never beat the market because of expenses, fees, and the growing mathematical difficulty of picking outperforming stocks (more on that later in this chapter). When you’re evaluating a fund, the only way to really gauge it is by looking at its track record for the last ten years or more.

To examine probability theory, let’s take a simple example of an unscrupulous scammer who wants to sell his financial services to some naive investors. He emails ten thousand people, telling half that Stock A will go up and telling the other half Stock B will go up. “This is just a freebie email to demonstrate my insider knowledge,” he might say. After a couple of weeks, he notices that Stock A has indeed gone up by chance. He eliminates the Stock B group and focuses on the Stock A group, emailing them an “I told you so” note. This time, he splits the mailing in half again. Twenty-five hundred people are told about Stock C and twenty-five hundred are told about Stock D. If either C or D goes up, on the next cycle, at least 1,250 people will have seen him pick two stocks successfully. And each cycle will make the recipients increasingly awed by his “ability.” Because we like to create order where there is none, we will ascribe magical stock-picking abilities to the scammer—even though it was literally by chance—and buy whatever “investment success kit” he’s selling. The same is true of the pages of “five-star funds” you see. Moral of the story: Don’t trust purported financial expertise just because of a few impressive stats.

You see, mutual funds use something called “active management.” This means a portfolio manager actively tries to pick the best stocks and give you the best return. Sounds good, right? But even with all the fancy analysts and technology they employ, portfolio managers still make fundamentally human mistakes, like selling too quickly, trading too much, and making rash guesses. These fund managers trade frequently so they can show short-term results to their shareholders and prove they’re doing something—anything!—to earn your money. Not only do they usually fail to beat the market, but they charge a fee to do this. Mutual funds typically charge 1 to 2 percent of assets managed each year. (This percentage is known as a fund’s expense ratio.) In other words, with a 2 percent expense ratio and a $10,000 portfolio, you’d pay $200 per year in fees. Some funds even tack on additional sales charges, or “loads,” to the purchase price (a front-end load) or sales price (back-end load) of the fund. These are just some of the tricky ways mutual fund managers make money whether they perform or not.

Some funds even tack on additional sales charges, or “loads,” to the purchase price (a front-end load) or sales price (back-end load) of the fund. These are just some of the tricky ways mutual fund managers make money whether they perform or not. Two percent doesn’t sound like much until you compare it with the alternative: “passive management.” This is how index funds (a cousin of mutual funds) are run. These funds work by replacing portfolio managers with computers. The computers don’t attempt to find the hottest stock. They simply and methodically pick the same stocks that an index holds—for example, the five hundred stocks in the S&P 500—in an attempt to match the market. (An index is a way to measure part of the stock market. For example, the NASDAQ index represents certain technology stocks, while the S&P 500 represents five hundred large US stocks. There are international indexes and even retail indexes.) Most index funds stay close to the market (or to the segment of the market they represent). Just as the stock market may fall 10 percent one year and gain 18 percent the next year, index funds will rise and fall with the indexes they track. The big difference is in fees: Index funds have lower fees than mutual funds, because there’s no expensive staff to pay. Vanguard’s S&P 500 index fund, for example, has an expense ratio of 0.14 percent. Remember, there are all kinds of index funds. International funds, healthcare funds, small-cap funds. There are even funds that match the overall US stock market, which means if the market goes down, these index funds will also go down. But over the long term, the overall stock market has consistently returned about 8 percent after inflation.

Think about that. A simple 2 percent in fees can cost you over half of your investment returns. Or that 1 percent fee. One percent can’t be that much, right? For the same fifty-year time period, that fee will cost you 39 percent of your returns. I know, I know. Maybe fifty years is too long to think about. Let’s try a thirty five-year outlook. What would a 1 percent fee cost you? Try a 28 percent reduction in your retirement returns, according to the Department of Labor. This is why I’m so fanatical about reducing fees.

So, if you’re thinking about using a broker or actively managed fund, call them and ask them a simple, point-blank question: “What were your after-tax, after-fee returns for the last ten, fifteen, and twenty years?” Yes, their response must include all fees and taxes. Yes, the return period must be at least ten years, because the last five years of any time period are too volatile to matter. And yes, I promise they won’t give you a straight answer, because that would be admitting that they didn’t beat the market consistently. It’s that hard to do.

By the way, I have mixed feelings about FIRE. On one hand, I love any strategy that helps people get more conscious about spending and saving. FIRE is an antidote to Americans’ tepid savings rate: It absolutely obliterates the usual 10 percent standard by showing that saving 25 percent, 40 percent, even 70 percent of your income is possible—if you get crystal clear about your goals. On the other hand, many FIRE adherents exhibit classic signs of stress, anxiety, and even depression, and think that hitting some mythical number in their spreadsheet will solve their unhappiness. It won’t.

There are index funds for the S&P 500, for Asia-Pacific funds, for real estate funds, and for anything else you can imagine. Just like mutual funds, they have ticker symbols (such as VFINX).

Target date funds are actually “funds of funds,” or collections made up of other funds, which offer automatic diversification. For example, a target date fund might include large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and international funds. (And those funds, in turn, will hold stocks from each of those areas.) In other words, your target date fund will own many funds, all of which own stocks and bonds. It sounds complicated, but believe it or not, this actually makes things simple for you, because you’ll have to own only one fund, and all the rest will be taken care of for you.

That’s why target date funds are great: They’re designed to appeal to people who are lazy. In other words, for many people, the ease of use of these funds far outweighs any minor loss of returns that might occur from taking the one-size-fits-all approach. In my opinion, if it means it will get you investing, the benefits of having one fund that handles all of your investments make up for any shortcomings.

Depending on what company your employer uses to administer your 401(k), your fund options may be a little pricey in terms of expense ratios (I consider anything over 0.75 percent expensive), but on balance, you’re getting huge tax advantages and employer-match benefits.

Anyway, Swensen suggests allocating your money in the following way: 30 percent—Domestic equities: US stock funds, including small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks 15 percent—Developed-world international equities: funds from developed foreign countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and France 5 percent—Emerging-market equities: funds from developing foreign countries, such as China, India, and Brazil. These are riskier than developed-world equities, so don’t go off buying these to fill 95 percent of your portfolio. 20 percent—Real estate investment trusts: also known as REITs. REITs invest in mortgages and residential and commercial real estate, both domestically and internationally. 15 percent—Government bonds: fixed-interest US securities, which provide predictable income and balance risk in your portfolio. As an asset class, bonds generally return less than stocks. 15 percent—Treasury inflation-protected securities: also known as TIPS, these treasury notes protect against inflation. Eventually you’ll want to own these, but they’d be the last ones I’d get after investing in all the better-returning options first.

Note: Once you own all the funds you need, you can split the money across funds according to your asset allocation—but don’t just split it evenly. Remember, your asset allocation determines how much money you invest in different areas. If you have $250 to invest per month and you buy seven index funds, the average person who knows nothing (i.e., most people) will split the money seven ways and send $35 to each. That’s wrong. Depending on your asset allocation, you’ll send more or less money to various funds, using this calculation: (Your monthly total amount of investing money) (Percentage of asset allocation for a particular investment) = Amount you’ll invest there. For example, if you’re investing $1,000 per month and your Swensen allocation recommends 30 percent for domestic equities, you’ll calculate ($1,000) (0.3) = $300 and put that toward your domestic-equity fund. Repeat for all other funds in your portfolio. Finally, if you opt for investing in your own index funds, you’ll have to rebalance about once a year, which will keep your funds in line with your target asset allocation.

Every situation is different, but here are some questions you can ask. (Remember: Tread gently. Nobody likes talking about money—especially if it means having to admit to their kids that they need help.) ■  Where did they learn about money? What did their parents teach them? ■  If they could wave a magic wand and be in any financial situation, what would it be? (Let them dream here. If they say “win the lottery,” encourage them. What would that mean? What would they do? Then get more realistic: “Okay, let’s assume you can’t win the lottery. What would your ideal situation look like five years from now?” Most parents have pragmatic dreams.) ■  How much do they make per month? How much do they spend? ■  What percentage of their income are they saving? (Almost nobody knows this. Be reassuring, not judgmental.) ■  Do they pay fees for their bank accounts and credit cards? ■  What’s their average monthly credit card balance? Out of curiosity (use that phrase), why isn’t it zero? How could they get it there? ■  Do they have any investments? If so, how did they choose them? ■  Do they own a mutual fund or funds? How much are they paying in fees? ■  Are they maximizing their 401(k)s, at least contributing as much as their company matches? ■  What about other retirement vehicles, like a Roth IRA? Do they have one? ■  Do they read iwillteachyoutoberich.com? NO? WHY NOT, DAD?!?! (Note: I highly recommend that you scream this really loudly at them.)

The only solution to the dilemma is King’s solution—to find a higher sense of purpose, a mission that will provide us our own direction, not that of our parents, friends, or peers. This mission is intimately connected to our individuality, to what makes us unique. As King expressed it: “We have a responsibility to set out to discover what we are made for, to discover our life’s work, to discover what we are called to do. And after we discover that, we should set out to do it with all the strength and all of the power that we can muster.” This “life’s work” is what we were intended to do, as dictated by our particular skills, gifts, and inclinations. It is our calling in life. For King, it was an impulse to find his own particular path, to fuse the practical with the spiritual. Finding this higher sense of purpose gives us the integration and direction we all crave. Consider this “life’s work” something that speaks to you from within—a voice. This voice will often warn you when you are getting involved in unnecessary entanglements or when you are about to follow career paths that are unsuited to your character, by the uneasiness that you feel. It directs you toward activities and goals that mesh with your nature. When you are listening to it, you feel like you have greater clarity and wholeness. If you listen closely enough, it will direct you toward your particular destiny. It can be seen as something spiritual or something personal, or both. It is not the voice of your ego, which wants attention and quick gratification, something that further divides you from within. Rather, it absorbs you in your work and what you have to do. It is sometimes hard to hear, as your head is full of the voices of others telling you what you should and should not do. Hearing it involves introspection, effort, and practice. When you follow its guidance, positive things tend to happen. You have the inner strength to do what you must and not be swayed by other people, who have their own agendas. Hearing this voice will connect you to your larger goals and help you avoid detours. It will make you more strategic, focused, and adaptive. Once you hear it and understand your purpose, there will be no going back. Your course has been set, and deviating from it will cause anxiety and pain.

Jealousy—at least as far as he understood it from his dream—was the most hopeless prison in the world. Jealousy was not a place he was forced into by someone else, but a jail in which the inmate entered voluntarily, locked the door, and threw away the key. And not another soul in the world knew he was locked inside. Of course if he wanted to escape, he could do so. The prison was, after all, his own heart. But he couldn’t make that decision. His heart was as hard as a stone wall. This was the very essence of jealousy.

“Franz Liszt’s ‘Le mal du pays.’ It’s from his Years of Pilgrimage suite ‘Year 1: Switzerland.’ ” “ ‘Le mal du …’?” “ ‘Le mal du pays.’ It’s French. Usually it’s translated as ‘homesickness,’ or ‘melancholy.’ If you put a finer point on it, it’s more like ‘a groundless sadness called forth in a person’s heart by a pastoral landscape.’ It’s a hard expression to translate accurately.”

“Everything has boundaries. The same holds true with thought. You shouldn’t fear boundaries, but you also should not be afraid of destroying them. That’s what is most important if you want to be free: respect for and exasperation with boundaries. What’s really important in life is always the things that are secondary. That’s about all I can say.”

Those kinds of things?” Haida nodded. “I made up my mind not to think about them,” Midorikawa said as he rubbed his beard. “It’s a waste of time to think about things you can’t know, and things you can’t confirm even if you know them. In the final analysis, that’s no different from the slippery slope of hypotheses you were talking about.”

“You’ll be going back to college in Tokyo before much longer,” Midorikawa quietly stated. “And you’ll return to real life. You need to live it to the fullest. No matter how shallow and dull things might get, this life is worth living. I guarantee it. And I’m not being either ironic or paradoxical. It’s just that, for me, what’s worthwhile in life has become a burden, something I can’t shoulder anymore. Maybe I’m just not cut out for it. So, like a dying cat, I’ve crawled into a quiet, dark place, silently waiting for my time to come. It’s not so bad. But you’re different. You should be able to handle what life sends your way. You need to use the thread of logic, as best you can, to skillfully sew onto yourself everything that’s worth living for.”

Tsukuru found a chance to invite her to dinner, then back to his apartment, and there he took the plunge and lured her into bed. She accepted his overtures with barely a moment’s hesitation. Though it was Tsukuru’s first time with a woman, things went smoothly—no confusion, no nervousness—from start to finish. Because of this, the woman seemed convinced that he was more sexually experienced than most young men his age, even though the only sex he’d had with women had been confined to dreams.

She brought color and vitality into Tsukuru’s post-Haida life. But he didn’t choose to sleep with her out of passion, or because he was fond of her, or even to lessen his loneliness. Though he probably would never have admitted it, he was hoping to prove to himself that he wasn’t gay, that he was capable of having sex with a real woman, not just in his dreams. This was his main objective. And he achieved his goal. She stayed overnight at his place on weekends, just as Haida had done not so long before. They would make love leisurely, sometimes having sex almost until dawn. As he made love to her, he tried hard to think of nothing beyond her and her body. He focused, switched off his imagination, and chased away everything that wasn’t there—Shiro and Kuro’s naked bodies, and Haida’s lips—as best he could. She was on the pill, so he could come freely inside her. She enjoyed sex with him and seemed to be satisfied. When she orgasmed she always cried out in a strange voice.

She was going to marry him in April. She planned to quit her job at the architectural firm and move to Sanjo City, where her fiancé worked. “So I won’t be able to see you anymore,” she told Tsukuru one day as they lay in bed. “He’s a very good person,” she said, resting her hand on Tsukuru’s. “We’re well suited to each other.” “I hate the thought of not seeing you again,” Tsukuru said, “but I suppose I should congratulate you.” “Thank you,” she said. Then, as if writing a tiny footnote at the corner of a page, she added, “I might have a chance to see you again, someday.” “That would be great,” Tsukuru said, though he found it hard to decipher that footnote. When she’s with her fiancé, he suddenly wondered, does she cry out in the same way? The two of them made love again. And he really did feel bad about not being able to see her once a week. He knew that if he wanted to avoid having graphic erotic dreams, and live more in the present, he needed a regular sexual partner. But still, her marriage was, if anything, a good development for him, as he’d never felt anything for her beyond a calm fondness and a healthy physical desire. And at that point Tsukuru was about to embark on a new stage in his life.

You weren’t the type to force someone to do something they didn’t want to do. You weren’t violent, we knew that. But Shiro was totally serious about it, obsessed even. You had a public face and a hidden, private face, she said. You had a dark, hidden side, something unhinged and detached from the side of you that everyone knew.

You—how should I put it?—helped the rest of us relax.” “Helped you relax?” Tsukuru repeated, surprised. “Like elevator music, you mean?” “No, not like that. It’s hard to explain, but having you there, we could be ourselves. You didn’t say much, but you had your feet solidly planted on the ground, and that gave the group a sense of security.

“It’s the first thing I always say at our new employee training seminars. I gaze around the room, pick one person, and have him stand up. And this is what I say: I have some good news for you, and some bad news. The bad news first. We’re going to have to rip off either your fingernails or your toenails with pliers. I’m sorry, but it’s already decided. It can’t be changed. I pull out a huge, scary pair of pliers from my briefcase and show them to everybody. Slowly, making sure everybody gets a good look. And then I say: Here’s the good news. You have the freedom to choose which it’s going to be—your fingernails, or your toenails. So, which will it be? You have ten seconds to make up your mind. If you’re unable to decide, we’ll rip off both your fingernails and your toenails. I start the count. At about eight seconds most people say, ‘The toes.’ Okay, I say, toenails it is. I’ll use these pliers to rip them off. But before I do, I’d like you to tell me something. Why did you choose your toes and not your fingers? The person usually says, ‘I don’t know. I think they probably hurt the same. But since I had to choose one, I went with the toes.’ I turn to him and warmly applaud him. And I say, Welcome to the real world.” Tsukuru gazed wordlessly at his old friend’s delicate face. “Each of us is given the freedom to choose,” Aka said, winking and smiling. “That’s the point of the story.”

He switched off the light beside his bed, and once more felt grateful that what had taken hold of his heart was a deep sorrow, not the yoke of intense jealousy.

“You said I look very different,” Tsukuru said. “I think I’ve changed, too. Sixteen years ago, after you banished me from the group, all I could think about for five months was dying. Death and nothing else. Not to exaggerate or anything, but I was really teetering on the brink. Standing on the edge, staring down at the abyss, unable to look away. Somehow, I was able to make my way back to the world I came from. But it wouldn’t have been surprising if I had actually died then. Something was wrong with me—mentally, I mean. I don’t know what would be the correct diagnosis—anxiety, depression. Something like that. But something was definitely abnormal. It wasn’t like I was confused, though. My mind was perfectly clear. Utterly still, with no static at all. A very strange condition, now that I think back on it.”

Tsukuru Tazaki is a wonderful, colorful person. A person who builds fantastic stations. A healthy thirty-six-year-old citizen, a voter, a taxpayer—someone who could fly all the way to Finland just to see me. You don’t lack anything. Be confident and be bold. That’s all you need. Never let fear and stupid pride make you lose someone who’s precious to you.”

You stay curious by taking a beginner’s mindset as often as possible. How would you approach something if you had never seen or thought about it before? A beginner’s mind acknowledges that you don’t know everything and still have more to learn. This attitude allows you to question even longstanding ideas and to ensure your work is aligned with your values. It also allows you to be more innovative than someone who’s cynical or bored. That desire to figure everything out elevates your creativity. It’s good stuff.

In any situation, whether it’s a meeting at a huge corporation or a coffee shop get-together with a fellow solo entrepreneur, I let my personality (with all its flaws) shine through. Especially in business situations, I’d rather the other party knows who I am as a person so we can see if we’ll work well together. I’m human and so are they. There’s no need to front.

And if there's something I'm not aware that I fear and you ask if I'm afraid of it, I'll probably develop a new fear right there on the spot.

The paradox of missing out The more you worry about missing out on things, the more of your actual life is consumed by worrying about what you’re missing. Constantly checking in on virtual activities means you’re peripherally participating in everything, without actually participating in anything. It takes you out of being present and puts you into observing someone else who is only partially present. Social media is a great example of FOMO (fear of missing out). The more we refresh our streams, the less we’re actually doing anything. So, our work suffers because we think we might miss something that someone else says, does or posts. The less time you spend catching up on what you think you’re missing out on, the more time you can actually live your life, do your work, or connect with others in a present way.

How I experiment I focus on the task at hand, not the end result. Focusing on the process allows serendipity and personal exploration to take over. Otherwise, I might inadvertently apply a subjective idea of how I want something to turn out, rather than what would be best for long-term discovery. I try not to create and judge at the same time. Creation and judgment are very different thought processes and can interfere with each other, so they must be done separately. I experiment and explore every idea first (writing it down, drawing it out, actually trying to do it). Only then do I move into editing, curating, and judging to improve and refine the idea. I break the experiment down into the smallest tasks possible. Then, I work completely on each small task. Only at the end do I tie all those tasks together. This prevents me from feeling overwhelmed or scared about tackling such a big project. I remember that these are experiments. They’re not full-time business ideas. First, I figure out how to run the experiment using the least resources possible. What is the core or essence of my idea that I can quickly prototype? Then I get that prototype in front of as many people as possible before pursuing it further. I fail fast. I don’t repeat myself. The same experiment can’t have a different result unless I change the variables. If I experiment with an idea and it doesn’t work, I either change things up or move onto a new idea. There’s no point doing the same experiment over and over, hoping for something new to happen. If I want a different outcome, I have to change the experiment up a little — refocus for a new audience, try a different medium, or experiment with a completely new idea.

Before I explore an idea, I sit with it for a while. What are my intentions? What is guiding those intentions? Are they external or internal?

The most important part of finishing anything is saying no. If I’m working on an idea, I say “no” to almost everything: new projects, new clients, social engagements—basically anything that would take my focus away from what I’m doing. I take breaks, but there’s a difference between breaks and things that cut into my ability to get the work done. I say no so I can say yes to what I’m currently doing – or I say yes to what I want to pursue.

There aren't really any experts, though, just people further along in their individual journeys. I guarantee that they all feel like frauds sometimes, too. But if you're good at your work and people value your opinion, then congratulations—you’re in the same group as the experts. You don't need a degree, publishing deal or keynote speaking gig for validation. Confidence means simply believing in your work and hard-earned experience while acknowledging that you’re never done learning. Experts can be wrong all the time. They can also be fearful. You don't have to be right to be confident (politicians are a great example of this truth in action); you just have to understand something enough to have an opinion – and then you have to accept that it could be wrong and feel willing to change at any time.

False Importance #1 Let’s start with the easiest one: making a big deal out of something small and displaying the corresponding rage or triumph. Something tiny has happened, and you are going to display an immense emotion. It doesn’t have to be an inherently positive or negative action. By taking something small and drawing a huge exaggerated conclusion, you can create both a funny situation, and amusement based on tension release. You can make a big deal out of something small happening or not happening. You can become extremely happy or extremely angry at something small happening or not happening. “This is TAP WATER? Do you know who I am?!” “You have TEN pens there? You sicken me.” “Is your watch from Timex? I hate you.” “Is your watch from Timex? Gosh, stop showing off.” Other examples include calling yourself a big deal when you get a plastic toy with your drive-thru meal, or incredible rage that you only got one ketchup packet. You can become extremely happy or extremely angry based on something someone does or says.

Even if you're not trying to be funny, just the way you come up with analogies on how you contrast and compare different concepts can make for really funny descriptions. How do you master the art of humorous descriptions? The first step is to attempt to disassociate from what you see, and just focus on the elements and traits of what you see. For example, in the case of PJ O'Rourke, you would disassociate that you were looking at a police officer, and focus on the elements and traits of the police officer. He was small, petite, scary, intimidating, powerful, fierce, authoritative, serious, severe, and elfin. What are two distinct concepts that would fit the descriptions above? O’Rourke identified a small animal, a hamster, and also played on the fact that this person had a strong physical and military capability who can attack. When you put those two concepts together you may come up with the funny image of an attack hamster. This

It sounded élitist, and it was. Not everyone is worth listening to. Yet Socrates’ élitism had no trace of snobbery or prejudice. He might have discriminated in the views he attended to, but the discrimination operated not on the basis of class or money, nor on the basis of military record or nationality, but on the basis of reason, which was – as he stressed – a faculty accessible to all.

The story encourages us to interpret our own unpopularity other than through the mocking eyes of local juries. Socrates was judged by 500 men of limited intelligence who harboured irrational suspicions because Athens had lost the Peloponnesian War and the defendant looked strange. And yet he maintained faith in the judgement of wider courts.

Epicureans. What immediately distinguished his philosophy was an emphasis on the importance of sensual pleasure: ‘Pleasure is the beginning and the goal of a happy life,’ asserted Epicurus, confirming what many had long thought but philosophy had rarely accepted. The philosopher confessed his love of excellent food: ‘The beginning and root of every good is the pleasure of the stomach. Even wisdom and culture must be referred to this.’ Philosophy properly performed was to be nothing less than a guide to pleasure: The man who alleges that he is not yet ready for philosophy or that the time for it has passed him by, is like the man who says that he is either too young or too old for happiness.

We don’t exist unless there is someone who can see us existing, what we say has no meaning until someone can understand, while to be surrounded by friends is constantly to have our identity confirmed; their knowledge and care for us have the power to pull us from our numbness. In small comments, many of them teasing, they reveal they know our foibles and accept them and so, in turn, accept that we have a place in the world. We can ask them ‘Isn’t he frightening?’ or ‘Do you ever feel that …?’ and be understood, rather than encounter the puzzled ‘No, not particularly’ – which can make us feel, even when in company, as lonely as polar explorers.

If we do not dwell on the risk of sudden disaster and pay a price for our innocence, it is because reality comprises two cruelly confusing characteristics: on the one hand, continuity and reliability lasting across generations; on the other, unheralded cataclysms. We find ourselves divided between a plausible invitation to assume that tomorrow will be much like today and the possibility that we will meet with an appalling event after which nothing will ever be the same again. It is because we have such powerful incentives to neglect the latter that Seneca invoked a goddess.

It wasn’t hypocrisy. Stoicism does not recommend poverty; it recommends that we neither fear nor despise it. It considers wealth to be, in the technical formulation, a productum, a preferred thing – neither an essential one nor a crime. Stoics may live with as many gifts of Fortune as the foolish. Their houses can be as grand, their furniture as beautiful. They are identified as wise by only one detail: how they would respond to sudden poverty. They would walk away from the house and the servants without rage or despair.

Conditions must have contrasted painfully with life in Rome. But in a letter to his mother, the former wealthy statesman explained that he had managed to accommodate himself to his circumstances, thanks to years of morning premeditations and periods of thin soup: Never did I trust Fortune, even when she seemed to be offering peace. All those blessings which she kindly bestowed on me – money, public office, influence – I relegated to a place from which she could take them back without disturbing me. Between them and me, I have kept a wide gap, and so she has merely taken them, not torn them from me.

Stillness is what aims the archer’s arrow. It inspires new ideas. It sharpens perspective and illuminates connections. It slows the ball down so that we might hit it. It generates a vision, helps us resist the passions of the mob, makes space for gratitude and wonder. Stillness allows us to persevere. To succeed. It is the key that unlocks the insights of genius, and allows us regular folks to understand them.

In these situations we must: Be fully present. Empty our mind of preconceptions. Take our time. Sit quietly and reflect. Reject distraction. Weigh advice against the counsel of our convictions. Deliberate without being paralyzed.

Yet traces of his horticultural enthusiasm survived in his philosophy, for in certain passages, he proposed that we should look at our difficulties like gardeners. At their roots, plants can be odd and unpleasant, but a person with knowledge and faith in their potential will lead them to bear beautiful flowers and fruit – just as, in life, at root level, there may be difficult emotions and situations which can nevertheless result, through careful cultivation, in the greatest achievements and joys.

The Utilitarians had argued that in a world beset by moral ambiguities, the way to judge whether an action was right or wrong was to measure the amount of pleasure and pain it gave rise to. Mill proposed that: [A]ctions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure.

Epictetus, Marcus’s philosophical predecessor, was in fact speaking about sports when he said, “If we’re anxious or nervous when we make the catch or throw, what will become of the game, and how can one maintain one’s composure; how can one see what is coming next?” As is true in athletics, so too in life. Yes, thinking is essential. Expert knowledge is undoubtedly key to the success of any leader or athlete or artist. The problem is that, unthinkingly, we think too much.

Epictetus talked about how the job of a philosopher is to take our impressions—what we see, hear, and think—and put them to the test. He said we needed to hold up our thoughts and examine them, to make sure we weren’t being led astray by appearances or missing what couldn’t be seen by the naked eye. Indeed, it is in Stoicism and Buddhism and countless other schools that we find the same analogy: The world is like muddy water. To see through it, we have to let things settle. We can’t be disturbed by initial appearances, and if we are patient and still, the truth will be revealed to us.

Seneca, the Stoic philosopher, seems to have done his writing and reflection in the evenings, much along the lines of Anne Frank’s practice. When darkness had fallen and his wife had gone to sleep, he explained to a friend, “I examine my entire day and go back over what I’ve done and said, hiding nothing from myself, passing nothing by.” Then he would go to bed, finding that “the sleep which follows this self-examination” was particularly sweet. Anyone who reads him today can feel him reaching for stillness in these nightly writings.

It’s dangerous business, though, creating a monster to protect your wounded inner child. The insecure lens. The anxious lens. The persecuted lens. The prove-them-all-wrong lens. The will-you-be-my-father? lens that Leonardo had. These adaptations, developed early on to make sense of the world, don’t make our lives easier. On the contrary. Who can be happy that way?

After recognizing and embracing our inner child, the third function of mindfulness is to soothe and relieve our difficult emotions. Just by holding this child gently, we are soothing our difficult emotions and we can begin to feel at ease. When we embrace our strong emotions with mindfulness and concentration, we’ll be able to see the roots of these mental formations. We’ll know where our suffering has come from. When we see the roots of things, our suffering will lessen. So mindfulness recognizes, embraces, and relieves.

It is an endless loop of misery. We’re envious of one person, while they envy somebody else. The factory worker wishes desperately to be a millionaire, the millionaire envies the simple life of the nine-to-five worker. The famous wish they could go back to the private life that so many others would gladly give away; the man or woman with a beautiful partner thinks only of someone a little more beautiful. It’s sobering to consider that the rival we’re so jealous of may in fact be jealous of us.

If you believe there is ever some point where you will feel like you’ve “made it,” when you’ll finally be good, you are in for an unpleasant surprise. Or worse, a sort of Sisyphean torture where just as that feeling appears to be within reach, the goal is moved just a little bit farther up the mountain and out of reach. You will never feel okay by way of external accomplishments. Enough comes from the inside. It comes from stepping off the train. From seeing what you already have, what you’ve always had.

Therefore, admitting that there is something bigger than you out there is an important breakthrough.

The credit card companies will tell you their ridiculously high interest rates are necessary insurance against people who defraud them or default on their balances. But the truth is that they make most of their money off people who can’t pay off their balances. It’s that simple. The card companies have found their infinite supply of cash flow—generation after generation of overspenders. Think about the credit card company that occupies a world where its average return is 16 percent. Now there’s a business that makes good money! Imagine if your investments paid you 16 percent, week after week, month after month, in perpetuity. How far would you go to protect that return? Pretty darn far, I bet. That’s why credit is so easy to come by. These companies throw out a global net to see which suckers they can snag into that morass of debt. And many of you get caught willingly. But here’s the problem: Once that 16 percent compounds, you’re in trouble, because you can never, ever earn a 16 percent return consistently and fast enough on anything to offset the insidious growth of that kind of debt. You can’t dig yourself out of that kind of hole. Nobody can.

Ask yourself every time you choose to whip out that card and buy something: Will the interest I pay on this item outlive my interest in this item? If the answer is yes, don’t buy it! Think of that attractive person you once dated years ago. Looking back now, it’s easy to see you didn’t actually need him or her. You don’t need that person now, right? But imagine if, contractually, you were obligated to keep spending time with the very person you now feel absolutely nothing for, until he or she says it’s over. Sounds insane, but many consumers are making exactly that bargain with things they purchase, things they said they loved and needed, yet days, weeks, and months later, they’re bound to keep paying for something they no longer enjoy.

Even if we are the products of evolution and randomness, does this not take us right back to the position of the Stoics? As subjects to the laws of gravity and physics, are we not already accepting a higher, inexplicable power? We have so little control of the world around us, so many inexplicable events created this world, that it works out almost exactly the same way as if there was a god. The point of this belief is in some ways to override the mind. To quiet it down by putting it in true perspective. The common language for accepting a higher power is about “letting [Him or Her or It] into your heart.” That’s it. This is about rejecting the tyranny of our intellect, of our immediate observational experience, and accepting something bigger, something beyond ourselves. Perhaps you’re not ready to do that, to let anything into your heart. That’s okay. There’s no rush. Just know that this step is open to you. It’s waiting.

Each morning, Churchill got up around eight and took his first bath, which he entered at 98 degrees and had cranked up to 104 while he sat (and occasionally somersaulted) in the water. Freshly bathed, he would spend the next two hours reading. Then he responded to his daily mail, mostly pertaining to his political duties. Around noon he’d stop in to say hello to his wife for the first time—believing all his life that the secret to a happy marriage was that spouses should not see each other before noon. Then he tackled whatever writing project he was working on—likely an article or a speech or a book. By early afternoon he would be writing at a fantastic clip and then abruptly stop for lunch (which he would finally dress for). After lunch, he would go for a walk around Chartwell, his estate in the English countryside, feeding his swans and fish—to him the most important and enjoyable part of the day. Then he would sit on the porch and take in the air, thinking and musing. For inspiration and serenity he might recite poetry to himself. At 3 p.m., it was time for a two-hour nap. After the nap, it was family time and then a second bath before a late, seated and formal dinner (after 8 p.m.). After dinner and drinks, one more writing sprint before bed. It was a routine he would stick to even on Christmas.

Churchill spoke eloquently of a reliance on new activities that use other parts of our minds and bodies to relieve the areas where we are overworked. “The cultivation of a hobby and new forms of interest is therefore a policy of first importance to a public man,” he wrote. “To be really happy and really safe, one ought to have at least two or three hobbies, and they must all be real.”

Painting, like all good hobbies, taught the practitioner to be present. “This heightened sense of observation of Nature,” he wrote, “is one of the chief delights that have come to me through trying to paint.” He had lived for forty years on planet Earth consumed by his work and his ambition, but through painting, his perspective and perception grew much sharper.

If we are to be half as productive as Churchill, and manage to capture the same joy and zest and stillness that defined his life, there are traits we will need to cultivate. Each of us will need to: Rise above our physical limitations. Find hobbies that rest and replenish us. Develop a reliable, disciplined routine. Spend time getting active outdoors. Seek out solitude and perspective. Learn to sit—to do nothing when called for. Get enough sleep and rein in our workaholism. Commit to causes bigger than ourselves.

Empedocles believed that there were two different forces at work in nature. He called them love and strife. Love binds things together, and strife separates them. He distinguishes between “substance” and “force.” This is worth noting.

Each of us needs to get better at saying no. As in, “No, sorry, I’m not available.” “No, sorry, that sounds great but I’d rather not.” “No, I’m going to wait and see.” “No, I don’t like that idea.” “No, I don’t need that—I’m going to make the most of what I have.” “No, because if I said yes to you, I’d have to say yes to everyone.” Maybe

The key to a good walk is to be aware. To be present and open to the experience. Put your phone away. Put the pressing problems of your life away, or rather let them melt away as you move. Look down at your feet. What are they doing? Notice how effortlessly they move. Is it you who’s doing that? Or do they just sort of move on their own? Listen to the sound of the leaves crunching underfoot. Feel the ground pushing back against you.

Look down at your feet. What are they doing? Notice how effortlessly they move. Is it you who’s doing that? Or do they just sort of move on their own? Listen to the sound of the leaves crunching underfoot. Feel the ground pushing back against you. Breathe in. Breathe out. Consider who might have walked this very spot in the centuries before you. Consider the person who paved the asphalt you are standing on. What was going on with them? Where are they now? What did they believe? What problems did they have? When you feel the tug of your responsibilities or the desire to check in with the outside world, push yourself a bit further. If you’re on a path you have trod before, take a sudden turn down a street or up a hill where you haven’t been before. Feel the unfamiliarity and the newness of these surroundings, drink in what you have not yet tasted. Get lost. Be unreachable. Go slowly. It’s an affordable luxury available to us all. Even the poorest pauper can go for a nice walk—in a national park or an empty parking lot.

The point is not, as in traditional meditation, to push every thought or observation from your mind. On the contrary, the whole point is to see what’s around you. The mind might be active while you do this, but it is still. It’s a different kind of thinking, a healthier kind if you do it right. A study at New Mexico Highlands University has found that the force from our footsteps can increase the supply of blood to the brain. Researchers at Stanford have found that walkers perform better on tests that measure “creative divergent thinking” during and after their walks. A study out of Duke University found a version of what Kierkegaard tried to tell his sister-in-law, that walking could be as effective a treatment for major depression in some patients as medication.

During breeding season, females often announce their fertility with loud, continuous wailing. Male cats advertise their sexuality using even more unacceptable methods. They will, if allowed, mark their territory with strong-smelling bursts of urine; roam the neighborhood in search of females; and routinely fight other outdoor males for mating rights. These behaviors can become so extreme that some intact males become impossible to keep as indoor pets. Fortunately, neutering and spaying usually end all of these behaviors, creating a healthier, happier, more manageable pet. For this reason, it is the duty of all responsible cat owners to take this step. (See “Spaying and Neutering”.) Selecting

Collar/Tags: Put a lightweight collar on your new cat or kitten, along with a tag containing its name and (at least) your telephone number, as soon as you acquire the feline. Add tags for appropriate vaccinations as soon as your cat receives them. A “breakaway” collar, which detaches if the cat catches it on an obstruction, is a mandatory safety feature.

How to Hold a Cat Most cats do not object to being lifted, provided that you make your intentions clear and handle the cat gently. Abrupt grabbing or lunging may cause the cat to flee beneath the nearest sofa. [1] Support the cat’s weight from underneath with one hand. Most cats will prefer to be right-side-up.

Selecting a Name Given enough time, felines will learn to recognize and respond to almost any name you care to give them. However, the most effective names are short and usually end with a long “ee” sound. Good choices include Dolly, Ally, and Teddy. Try to avoid monikers that contain pronounced hissing sounds (Sissy, Sheba, etc.), and resist the urge to give complicated names, such as Alexandra.

Blinking: Cats usually meet strangers and potential adversaries (feline, human, and otherwise) with an unblinking, unflinching stare. In the cat world, the ultimate gesture of trust and acceptance is for one model to close its eyes in the company of another. A feline that greets its owner’s presence with long, unconcerned blinks or languid, half-closed eyes is signaling deep trust.

Cat urine contains high concentrations of ammonia, which makes its smell particularly annoying to humans—and particularly difficult to expunge from furnishings. Yet the odor must be removed, or the cat will be strongly tempted to use the spot again. First, wash the area with carbonated water or soapy water, and then rinse. Further usage may be deterred by applying a misting of vinegar or mouthwash to the spot, both of which cats find distasteful.

They are easy to assemble, she thought. Even though they are all different, they all fit together. They are also unbreakable. She couldn’t even remember having seen a broken Lego block. All her blocks looked as bright and new as the day they were bought, many years ago. The best thing about them was that with Legos she could construct any kind of object. And then she could separate the blocks and construct something new.

The natural philosophers had been mainly concerned with the nature of the physical world. This gives them a central position in the history of science. In Athens, interest was now focused on the individual and the individual’s place in society. Gradually a democracy evolved, with popular assemblies and courts of law.

By playing ignorant, Socrates forced the people he met to use their common sense. Socrates could feign ignorance—or pretend to be dumber than he was. We call this Socratic irony. This enabled him to continually expose the weaknesses in people’s thinking. He was not averse to doing this in the middle of the city square. If you met Socrates, you thus might end up being made a fool of publicly.

Both Jesus and Socrates were enigmatic personalities, also to their contemporaries. Neither of them wrote down their teachings, so we are forced to rely on the picture we have of them from their disciples. But we do know that they were both masters of the art of discourse. They both spoke with a characteristic self-assuredness that could fascinate as well as exasperate. And not least, they both believed that they spoke on behalf of something greater than themselves. They challenged the power of the community by criticizing all forms of injustice and corruption.

Very briefly, the Sophists thought that perceptions of what was right or wrong varied from one city-state to another, and from one generation to the next. So right and wrong was something that “flowed.” This was totally unacceptable to Socrates. He believed in the existence of eternal and absolute rules for what was right or wrong. By using our common sense we can all arrive at these immutable norms, since human reason is in fact eternal and immutable. Do

Plato believed that everything tangible in nature “flows.” So there are no “substances” that do not dissolve. Absolutely everything that belongs to the “material world” is made of a material that time can erode, but everything is made after a timeless “mold” or “form” that is eternal and immutable.

We can only have opinions about things that belong to the world of the senses, tangible things. We can only have true knowledge of things that can be understood with our reason. All right, Sophie, I’ll explain it more clearly: a gingerbread man can be so lopsided after all that baking that it can be quite hard to see what it is meant to be. But having seen dozens of gingerbread men that were more or less successful, I can be pretty sure what the cookie mold was like. I can guess, even though I have never seen it. It might not even be an advantage to see the actual mold with my own eyes because we cannot always trust the evidence of our senses. The faculty of vision can vary from person to person. On the other hand, we can rely on what our reason tells us because that is the same for everyone.

When you see a shadow, Sophie, you will assume that there must be something casting a shadow. You see the shadow of an animal. You think it may be a horse, but you are not quite sure. So you turn around and see the horse itself—which of course is infinitely more beautiful and sharper in outline than the blurred “horse-shadow.” Plato believed similarly that all natural phenomena are merely shadows of the eternal forms or ideas. But most people are content with a life among shadows. They give no thought to what is casting the shadows. They think shadows are all there are, never realizing even that they are, in fact, shadows. And thus they pay no heed to the immortality of their own soul. Out

Plato’s point was that the relationship between the darkness of the cave and the world beyond corresponds to the relationship between the forms of the natural world and the world of ideas. Not that he meant that the natural world is dark and dreary, but that it is dark and dreary in comparison with the clarity of ideas. A picture of a beautiful landscape is not dark and dreary either. But it is only a picture.

According to Plato, the human body is composed of three parts: the head, the chest, and the abdomen. For each of these three parts there is a corresponding faculty of the soul. Reason belongs to the head, will belongs to the chest, and appetite belongs to the abdomen. Each of these soul faculties also has an ideal, or “virtue.” Reason aspires to wisdom, Will aspires to courage, and Appetite must be curbed so that temperance can be exercised. Only when the three parts of the body function together as a unity do we get a harmonious or “virtuous” individual. At school, a child must first learn to curb its appetites, then it must develop courage, and finally reason leads to wisdom.

Plato thought that all the things we see in the natural world were purely reflections of things that existed in the higher reality of the world of ideas—and thereby in the human soul. Aristotle thought the opposite: things that are in the human soul were purely reflections of natural objects. So nature is the real world. According to Aristotle, Plato was trapped in a mythical world picture in which the human imagination was confused with the real world.

Yes, I’ll explain what I mean, Sophie. See if this funny story helps you. A sculptor is working on a large block of granite. He hacks away at the formless block every day. One day a little boy comes by and says, “What are you looking for?” “Wait and see,” answers the sculptor. After a few days the little boy comes back, and now the sculptor has carved a beautiful horse out of the granite. The boy stares at it in amazement, then he turns to the sculptor and says, “How did you know it was in there?” How indeed! In a sense, the sculptor had seen the horse’s form in the block of granite, because that particular block of granite had the potentiality to be formed into the shape of a horse. Similarly Aristotle believed that everything in nature has the potentiality of realizing, or achieving, a specific “form.”

Why does it rain, Sophie? You have probably learned at school that it rains because the moisture in the clouds cools and condenses into raindrops that are drawn to the earth by the force of gravity. Aristotle would have nodded in agreement. But he would have added that so far you have only mentioned three of the causes. The “material cause” is that the moisture (the clouds) was there at the precise moment when the air cooled. The “efficient cause” is that the moisture cools, and the “formal cause” is that the “form,” or nature of the water, is to fall to the earth. But if you stopped there, Aristotle would add that it rains because plants and animals need rainwater in order to grow. This he called the “final cause.” Aristotle assigns the raindrops a life-task, or “purpose.”

Saying animal, vegetable, and mineral reminds me of that party game where the victim is sent outside the room, and when he comes in again he has to guess what everyone else is thinking of. Everyone has agreed to think of Fluffy, the cat, which at the moment is in the neighbor’s garden. The victim comes in and begins to guess. The others must only answer “yes” or “no.” If the victim is a good Aristotelian—and therefore no victim—the game could go pretty much as follows: Is it concrete? (Yes!) Mineral? (No!) Is it alive? (Yes!) Vegetable? (No!) Animal? (Yes!) Is it a bird? (No!) Is it a mammal? (Yes!) Is it the whole animal? (Yes!) Is it a cat? (Yes!) Is it Fluffy? (Yeah! Laughter…)

Aristotle then emphasized that all three criteria must be present at the same time for man to find happiness and fulfillment. He rejected all forms of imbalance.

Then there was the next question: “Indicate some of the factors contributing to a person’s philosophy of life.” Upbringing and environment were important here. People living at the time of Plato had a different philosophy of life than many people have today because they lived in a different age and a different environment. Another factor was the kind of experience people chose to get themselves. Common sense was not determined by environment. Everybody had that. Maybe one could compare environment and social situation with the conditions that existed deep down in Plato’s cave. By using their intelligence individuals can start to drag themselves up from the darkness. But a journey like that requires personal courage. Socrates is a good example of a person who managed to free himself from the prevailing views of his time by his own intelligence. Finally, she wrote: “Nowadays, people of many lands and cultures are being intermingled more and more. Christians, Muslims, and Buddhists may live in the same apartment building. In which case it is more important to accept each other’s beliefs than to ask why everyone does not believe the same thing.”

She wrote that we know the moon is not made of green cheese and that there are also craters on the dark side of the moon, that both Socrates and Jesus were sentenced to death, that everybody has to die sooner or later, that the great temples on the Acropolis were built after the Persian wars in the fifth century B.C. and that the most important oracle in ancient Greece was the oracle at Delphi. As examples of what we can only believe, Sophie mentioned the questions of whether or not there is life on other planets, whether God exists or not, whether there is life after death, and whether Jesus was the son of God or merely a wise man. “We can certainly not know where the world came from,” she wrote, completing her list. “The universe can be compared to a large rabbit pulled out of a top hat. Philosophers try to climb up one of the fine hairs of the rabbit’s fur and stare straight into the eyes of the Great Magician. Whether they will ever succeed is an open question. But if each philosopher climbed onto another one’s back, they would get even higher up in the rabbit’s fur, and then, in my opinion, there would be some chance they would make it some day. P.S. In the Bible there is something that could have been one of the fine hairs of the rabbit’s fur. The hair was called the Tower of Babel, and it was destroyed because the Magician didn’t want the tiny human insects to crawl up that high out of the white rabbit he had just created.”

As I have said, Hellenistic philosophy continued to work with the problems raised by Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Common to them all was their desire to discover how mankind should best live and die. They were concerned with ethics. In the new civilization, this became the central philosophical project. The main emphasis was on finding out what true happiness was and how it could be achieved. We are going to look at four of these philosophical trends.

Antisthenes had been a pupil of Socrates, and had become particularly interested in his frugality. The Cynics emphasized that true happiness is not found in external advantages such as material luxury, political power, or good health. True happiness lies in not being dependent on such random and fleeting things. And because happiness does not consist in benefits of this kind, it is within everyone’s reach. Moreover, having once been attained, it can never be lost. The best known of the Cynics was Diogenes, a pupil of Antisthenes, who reputedly lived in a barrel and owned nothing but a cloak, a stick, and a bread bag. (So it wasn’t easy to steal his happiness from him!) One day while he was sitting beside his barrel enjoying the sun, he was visited by Alexander the Great. The emperor stood before him and asked if there was anything he could do for him. Was there anything he desired? “Yes,” Diogenes replied. “Stand to one side. You’re blocking the sun.” Thus Diogenes showed that he was no less happy and rich than the great man before him. He had everything he desired. The Cynics believed that people did not need to be concerned about their own health. Even suffering and death should not disturb them. Nor should they let themselves be tormented by concern for other people’s woes. Nowadays the terms “cynical” and “cynicism” have come to mean a sneering disbelief in human sincerity, and they imply insensitivity to other people’s suffering.

The Cynics were instrumental in the development of the Stoic school of philosophy, which grew up in Athens around 300 B.C. Its founder was Zeno, who came originally from Cyprus and joined the Cynics in Athens after being shipwrecked. He used to gather his followers under a portico. The name “Stoic” comes from the Greek word for portico (stoa). Stoicism was later to have great significance for Roman culture. Like Heraclitus, the Stoics believed that everyone was a part of the same common sense—or “logos.” They thought that each person was like a world in miniature, or “microcosmos,” which is a reflection of the “macrocosmos.” This led to the thought that there exists a universal rightness, the so-called natural law. And because this natural law was based on timeless human and universal reason, it did not alter with time and place. In this, then, the Stoics sided with Socrates against the Sophists. Natural law governed all mankind, even slaves. The Stoics considered the legal statutes of the various states merely as incomplete imitations of the “law” embedded in nature itself. In the same way that the Stoics erased the difference between the individual and the universe, they also denied any conflict between “spirit” and “matter.” There is only one nature, they averred. This kind of idea is called monism (in contrast to Plato’s clear dualism or two-fold reality). As true children of their time, the Stoics were distinctly “cosmopolitan,” in that they were more receptive to contemporary culture than the “barrel philosophers” (the Cynics). They drew attention to human fellowship, they were preoccupied with politics, and many of them, notably the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (A.D. 121–180), were active statesmen. They encouraged Greek culture and philosophy in Rome, one of the most distinguished of them being the orator, philosopher, and statesman Cicero (106–43 B.C.). It was he who formed the very concept of “humanism”—that is, a view of life that has the individual as its central focus. Some years later, the Stoic Seneca (4 B.C.–A.D. 65) said that “to mankind, mankind is holy.” This has remained a slogan for humanism ever since. The Stoics, moreover, emphasized that all natural processes, such as sickness and death, follow the unbreakable laws of nature. Man must therefore learn to accept his destiny. Nothing happens accidentally. Everything happens through necessity, so it is of little use to complain when fate comes knocking at the door. One must also accept the happy events of life unperturbed, they thought. In this we see their kinship with the Cynics, who claimed that all external events were unimportant. Even today we use the term “stoic calm” about someone who does not let his feelings take over.

Remember Plato’s doctrine of ideas, Sophie, and the way he distinguished between the world of ideas and the sensory world. This meant establishing a clear division between the soul and the body. Man thus became a dual creature: our body consisted of earth and dust like everything else in the sensory world, but we also had an immortal soul. This was widely believed by many Greeks long before Plato. Plotinus was also familiar with similar ideas from Asia.

We said that the most important of the senses for Indo-Europeans was sight. How important hearing was to the Semitic cultures is just as interesting. It is no accident that the Jewish creed begins with the words: “Hear, O Israel!” In the Old Testament we read how the people “heard” the word of the Lord, and the Jewish prophets usually began their sermons with the words: “Thus spake Jehovah (God).” “Hearing” the word of God is also emphasized in Christianity. The religious ceremonies of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are all characterized by reading aloud or “reciting.”

When kings were chosen, they were anointed by the people. They thus received the title Messiah, which means “the anointed one.” In a religious sense kings were looked upon as a go-between between God and His people. The king could therefore also be called the “Son of God” and the country could be called the “Kingdom of God.”

When we talked about Socrates, we saw how dangerous it could be to appeal to people’s reason. With Jesus we see how dangerous it can be to demand unconditional brotherly love and unconditional forgiveness. Even in the world of today we can see how mighty powers can come apart at the seams when confronted with simple demands for peace, love, food for the poor, and amnesty for the enemies of the state. You may recall how incensed Plato was that the most righteous man in Athens had to forfeit his life. According to Christian teachings, Jesus was the only righteous person who ever lived. Nevertheless he was condemned to death. Christians say he died for the sake of humanity. This is what Christians usually call the “Passion” of Christ. Jesus was the “suffering servant” who bore the sins of humanity in order that we could be “atoned” and saved from God’s wrath.

“What kind of truths are relevant, then?” “According to Kierkegaard, rather than searching for the Truth with a capital T, it is more important to find the kind of truths that are meaningful to the individual’s life.

“A person who lives at the aesthetic stage can easily experience angst, or a sense of dread, and a feeling of emptiness. If this happens, there is also hope. According to Kierkegaard, angst is almost positive. It is an expression of the fact that the individual is in an ‘existential situation,’ and can now elect to make the great leap to a higher stage. But it either happens or it doesn’t. It doesn’t help to be on the verge of making the leap if you don’t do it completely. It is a matter of ‘either/or.’ But nobody can do it for you.

Many people live at the same stage all their life.” “I bet there’s an explanation on the way. I’m anxious to know which stage I’m at.” “He who lives at the aesthetic stage lives for the moment and grasps every opportunity of enjoyment. Good is whatever is beautiful, satisfying, or pleasant.

What matters is that you choose to have an opinion at all on what is right or wrong. The aesthete’s only concern is whether something is fun or boring.”

“Descartes maintains that we cannot accept anything as being true unless we can clearly and distinctly perceive it. To achieve this can require the breaking down of a compound problem into as many single factors as possible. Then we can take our point of departure in the simplest idea of all. You could say that every single thought must be weighed and measured, rather in the way Galileo wanted everything to be measured and everything immeasurable to be made measurable. Descartes believed that philosophy should go from the simple to the complex. Only then would it be possible to construct a new insight. And finally it would be necessary to ensure by constant enumeration and control that nothing was left out. Then, a philosophical conclusion would be within reach.”

“But Descartes tried to work forward from this zero point. He doubted everything, and that was the only thing he was certain of. But now something struck him: one thing had to be true, and that was that he doubted. When he doubted, he had to be thinking, and because he was thinking, it had to be certain that he was a thinking being. Or, as he himself expressed it: ‘Cogito, ergo sum.’” “Which means?” “I think, therefore I am.”

In the question of all the ideas we have about outer reality—for example, the sun and the moon—there is the possibility that they are fantasies. But outer reality also has certain characteristics that we can perceive with our reason. These are the mathematical properties, or, in other words, the kinds of things that are measurable, such as length, breadth, and depth. Such ‘quantitative’ properties are just as clear and distinct to my reason as the fact that I am a thinking being. ‘Qualitative’ properties such as color, smell, and taste, on the other hand, are linked to our sense perception and as such do not describe outer reality.”

“Even Descartes could not deny that there is a constant interaction between mind and body. As long as the mind is in the body, he believed, it is linked to the brain through a special brain organ which he called the pineal gland, where a constant interaction takes place between ‘spirit’ and ‘matter.’ Therefore the mind can constantly be affected by feelings and passions that are related to bodily needs. But the mind can also detach itself from such ‘base’ impulses and operate independently of the body. The aim is to get reason to assume command. Because even if I have the worst pain in my stomach, the sum of the angles in a triangle will still be 180 degrees. Thus humans have the capacity to rise above bodily needs and behave rationally. In this sense the mind is superior to the body. Our legs can age and become weak, the back can become bowed and our teeth can fall out—but two and two will go on being four as long as there is reason left in us. Reason doesn’t become bowed and weak. It is the body that ages. For Descartes, the mind is essentially thought. Baser passions and feelings such as desire and hate are more closely linked to our bodily functions—and therefore to extended reality.”

You may recall how Descartes wished to use a mathematical method of philosophical reflection. By this he meant a form of philosophic reflection that was constructed from strictly logical conclusions. Spinoza was part of the same rationalistic tradition. He wanted his ethics to show that human life is subject to the universal laws of nature. We must therefore free ourselves from our feelings and our passions. Only then will we find contentment and be happy, he believed.”

Spinoza is not an easy philosopher to grasp. Let’s take him bit by bit. You remember that Descartes believed that reality consisted of two completely separate substances, namely thought and extension.” “How could I have forgotten it?” “The word ‘substance’ can be interpreted as ‘that which something consists of,’ or that which something basically is or can be reduced to. Descartes operated then with two of these substances. Everything was either thought or extension.

According to Spinoza we humans recognize two of God’s qualities or manifestations. Spinoza called these qualities God’s attributes, and these two attributes are identical with Descartes’s ‘thought’ and ‘extension.’ God—or nature—manifests itself either as thought or as extension. It may well be that God has infinitely more attributes than ‘thought’ and ‘extension,’ but these are the only two that are known to man.”

And the clearer such ideas may be, the more certain it is that they correspond to reality. You recall how Descartes had a clear and distinct idea of a ‘perfect entity,’ on the basis of which he concluded that God exists.” “I am not especially forgetful.” “Rationalist thinking of this kind was typical for philosophy of the seventeenth century. It was also firmly rooted in the Middle Ages, and we remember it from Plato and Socrates too. But in the eighteenth century it was the object of an ever increasing in-depth criticism.

“An empiricist will derive all knowledge of the world from what the senses tell us. The classic formulation of an empirical approach came from Aristotle. He said: ‘There is nothing in the mind except what was first in the senses.’ This view implied a pointed criticism of Plato, who had held that man brought with him a set of innate ‘ideas’ from the world of ideas. Locke repeats Aristotle’s words, and when Locke uses them, they are aimed at Descartes.”

“The first was the Englishman John Locke, who lived from 1632 to 1704. His main work was the Essay Concerning Human Understanding, published in 1690. In it he tried to clarify two questions. First, where we get our ideas from, and secondly, whether we can rely on what our senses tell us.”

“Before we sense anything, then, the mind is as bare and empty as a blackboard before the teacher arrives in the classroom. Locke also compared the mind to an unfurnished room. But then we begin to sense things. We see the world around us, we smell, taste, feel, and hear. And nobody does this more intensely than infants. In this way what Locke called simple ideas of sense arise. But the mind does not just passively receive information from outside it. Some activity happens in the mind as well. The single sense ideas are worked on by thinking, reasoning, believing, and doubting, thus giving rise to what he calls reflection. So he distinguished between ‘sensation’ and ‘reflection.’ The mind is not merely a passive receiver. It classifies and processes all sensations as they come streaming in. And this is just where one must be on guard.”

“By primary qualities he meant extension, weight, motion and number, and so on. When it is a question of qualities such as these, we can be certain that the senses reproduce them objectively. But we also sense other qualities in things. We say that something is sweet or sour, green or red, hot or cold. Locke calls these secondary qualities. Sensations like these—color, smell, taste, sound—do not reproduce the real qualities that are inherent in the things themselves. They reproduce only the effect of the outer reality on our senses.” “Everyone to his own taste, in other words.” “Exactly.

If you buy into the full-scary narratives promoted by either the political left or the political right, you’re probably experiencing loserthink. A more useful way to think of the political news is that nearly every major story is exaggerated to the point of falsehood, with the intention of scaring the public. If you think the frightened feeling you are getting from the news is legitimate and appropriate, you probably don’t understand how the business model of the news has changed. Twenty years ago, if the media said something dangerous and scary was heading our way, you had to treat that seriously. Today, the news provides one fright after another, but an understanding of why they do it helps you avoid loserthink.

All the doom-and-gloom in the press, and on social media, could give you the impression the world is in big trouble. The reality is almost directly the opposite: things have never been better for humanity, and the future looks incredible too.

No matter the topic, all sides typically believe they have the right facts and the other side is delusional. No matter which side is right on any given topic, the one thing we know for sure is that being right and being wrong feel exactly the same to all of us. We can’t tell the difference. If we could, everyone would agree on everything important.

You cannot sacrifice character for joyfulness without ultimately destroying happiness. You cannot control the situation, but you can control yourself, your emotions, and your life. You cannot have women love you until you love yourself. You cannot grasp the female nature until you grasp your male nature. You cannot win her until you focus on her winning you.

Eighth Girl Nice guys vs. jerks isn't the real issue here, it is all about confidence. The major difference between nice guys and jerks is this: if a nice guy has the guts to approach a woman who has caught his attention, he is so worried about saying the perfect "nice" thing that he will totally flub it. The "nice" one ends up stumbling away from the object of his desires with his tail caught between his legs ... for those who don't already realize, this is NOT the impression you want to make! A jerk, on the other hand, appears to have been blessed with ability to approach anyone and say just what's on his mind completely disregarding any of the repercussions. He just does it. I have no clue how he does it. But DAMN, the man who has the confidence to accomplish that has caught my eye for the night whether he wants it or not! What does this say? She is saying: "Stop trying to say the perfect thing!" This was why I left 'Seduction' behind and gone the Natural route. It is more fun, less headaches, and gets better effects. Ninth Girl Don't think women don't like nice guys. There is an initial appeal to a jerk, but it doesn't last long. As long as you don't act desperate and have a little something going for you, believe me, a nice guy CAN finish first - and with the girl of his dreams.

To INCREASE testosterone No, do not run out and get shots. In our modern world cubicles and style, we are at desks and usually not in a state of action. But there are some easy ways to increase one's testosterone naturally and have the effects of: -Greater Confidence -Action -Boldness -Strength No more analyzing Turn OFF your computer and stop reading and rereading seduction knowledge. The only true benifet of the seduction material was not in the HOWs of getting seduction, it was opening your eyes of how Nature actually works. When I was a Nice Guy and read Tony's Get Laid Guy, it did a number on my head. It smashed all my nice guy 'philosophies'. Build up the Body Oddly, working out does seem to have more psychological effects then physical ones. Jerks always usally have nice bodies. Keep in the state of action. 62 Several of the guys in the 'health and fitness' forum we never hear from in the other forums. WHY? Because they know they don't need philosophies. Listen to Anthony Ellis of the skinnyguy.net who says: You have to have that drive and determination, and the change has to come from within. All the exterior things they don't mean much. You want to change the way you see life. You want to change your relationships. You want to make your workplace better. You want to be happier. But Mr. Ellis, who went from scrawny guy to impressive muscle guy, I have noticed people who discovered that when they can change their bodies, they can change their whole lives. Did you notice that? I'm definitely more confident. I believe in myself a lot more. I feel I can do other things I would never have thought to do before. I'm not afraid to be out at night, and that's a big deal for me. I enjoy the city so much more. I'm a part of it now. And doing this is not brain surgery; I didn't save someone's life. But I improved my life, which is very difficult to do. How many people are trying to lose fat? How many are trying to gain muscle? How many people are trying to get control of their lives? I have, and I feel empowered. I have no doubt any direction I choose to take my life will be successful. You've kept this up for about a year now. You've got the solid muscle mass, a great physique, a great outlook, but what does long-term success mean to you? Is this going to be part of it? This is definitely part of my life now. It's a permanent fixture. I may make slight adjustments, but once you go on this trip, there's no return ticket. You don't want to go back. It's like going to Hawaii. You don't want to come back because you have seen the other side. Once you get going, once you get the momentum going, once you start looking better, once you start feeling better, you don't want to stop. You want to keep exercising, to keep looking good and feeling good. What do you tell people who don't believe this is possible? When I meet people with that type of attitude people who say, "That's not possible" I tell them, "For you it's not possible because you don't believe it. If you don't believe you can do it, you can't." I think they need to believe it before it will work for them. When they open their minds, things are going to start happening. Doors are going to start opening. They see the reality of the situation. It's absolutely 100% necessary to believe you can do it. I mean really believe it deep down inside. I've come to realize that most of what happens to you is a result of you. It all comes from inside. Everything you do, everything you are, how you handle everything that happens to you is your responsibility. So if you want to change, look inside. When you decide to change from the inside, the outside will fall into place. For as you think, you shall become. This is why the focus must always remain ON 63 YOU. Some other things: Joining a Sport Every male needs good 'ol competition. Ever notice why the 'jocks' get the girls? Perhaps its because their testosterone levels shoot up or at least appear to? Eating More For skinny guys, this is a must. It strengthens the body. Don't take yourself so seriously This is for the shy and hesitant guys. You need to get over the fact that the world does not revolve around you. It never has and never will. No one will care if you hit on a chick. No one will care if you make a move on her. Do not rationalize away your desires. Start doing some of the things the 'awful' jerks do. Try getting on stage and being some rock star. Your testosterone levels will shoot up. Try acting. Since projection is all, your levels of testosterone will rise. Women will naturally sense it (and also because it will spring off other actions).

Those who have to earn a living get their share of boredom, of necessity, in working hours, but those who have enough money to be freed from the need of work have as their ideal a life completely freed from boredom. It is a noble ideal, and far be it from me to decry it, but I am afraid that like other ideals it is more difficult of achievement than the idealists suppose. After all, the mornings are boring in proportion as the previous evenings were amusing. There will be middle age, possibly even old age. At twenty men think that life will be over at thirty. I, at the age of fifty-eight, can no longer take that view. Perhaps it is as unwise to spend one’s vital capital as one’s financial capital.

The special kind of boredom from which modern urban populations suffer is intimately bound up with their separation from the life of Earth. It makes life hot and dusty and thirsty, like a pilgrimage in the desert. Among those who are rich enough to choose their way of life, the particular brand of unendurable boredom from which they suffer is due, paradoxical as this may seem, to their fear of boredom. In flying from the fructifying kind of boredom, they fall a prey to the other far worse kind. A happy life must be to a great extent a quiet life, for it is only in an atmosphere of quiet that true joy can live.

I have done in my time a considerable amount of public speaking; at first every audience terrified me, and nervousness made me speak very badly; I dreaded the ordeal so much that I always hoped I might break my leg before I had to make a speech, and when it was over I was exhausted from the nervous strain. Gradually I taught myself to feel that it did not matter whether I spoke well or ill, the universe would remain much the same in either case. I found that the less I cared whether I spoke well or badly, the less badly I spoke, and gradually the nervous strain diminished almost to vanishing point. A great deal of nervous fatigue can be dealt with in this way.

When some misfortune threatens, consider seriously and deliberately what is the very worst that could possibly happen. Having looked this possible misfortune in the face, give yourself sound reasons for thinking that after all it would be no such very terrible disaster. Such reasons always exist, since at the worst nothing that happens to oneself has any cosmic importance. When you have looked for some time steadily at the worst possibility and have said to yourself with real conviction, “Well, after all, that would not matter so very much,” you will find that your worry diminishes to a quite extraordinary extent. It may be necessary to repeat the process a few times, but in the end, if you have shirked nothing in facing the worst possible issue, you will find that your worry disappears altogether and is replaced by a kind of exhilaration.

In the modern world the most important part of this problem arises in youth. If a man is once launched upon the right career and in the right surroundings, he can in most cases escape social persecution, but while he is young and his merits are still untested, he is liable to be at the mercy of ignorant people who consider themselves capable of judging in matters about which they know nothing, and who are outraged at the suggestion that so young a person may know better than they do with all their experience of the world. Many people who have ultimately escaped from the tyranny of ignorance have had so hard a fight and so long a time of repression that in the end they are embittered and their energy is impaired. There is a comfortable doctrine that genius will always make its way, and on the strength of this doctrine many people consider that the persecution of youthful talent cannot do much harm. But there is no ground whatever for accepting this doctrine. It is like the theory that murder will out. Obviously all the murders we know of have been discovered, but who knows how many there may be which have never been heard of? In like manner all the men of genius that we have ever heard of have triumphed over adverse circumstances, but that is no reason for supposing that there were not innumerable others who succumbed in youth. Moreover it is not a question only of genius, but also of talent, which is just as necessary to the community. And it is not only a question of emerging somehow, but also of emerging unembittered and with unimpaired energy. For all these reasons the way of youth should not be made too hard.

Not so very far removed from the devotion to obscure causes is absorption in a hobby. One of the most eminent of living mathematicians divides his time equally between mathematics and stamp-collecting. I imagine that the latter affords consolation at the moments when he can make no progress with the former. The difficulty of proving propositions in the theory of numbers is not the only sorrow that stamp-collecting can cure, nor are stamps the only things that can be collected. Consider what a vast field of ecstasy opens before the imagination when one thinks of old china, snuffboxes, Roman coins, arrowheads, and flint implements. It is true that many of us are too “superior” for these simple pleasures. We have all experienced them in boyhood, but have thought them, for some reason, unworthy of a grown man. This is a complete mistake; any pleasure that does no harm to other people is to be valued.

The kind that makes for happiness is the kind that likes to observe people and finds pleasure in their individual traits, that wishes to afford scope for the interests and pleasures of those with whom it is brought into contact without desiring to acquire power over them or to secure their enthusiastic admiration.

If, on the other hand, you have as part of the habitual furniture of your mind the past ages of man, his slow and partial emergence out of barbarism, and the brevity of his total existence in comparison with astronomical epochs—if, I say, such thoughts have molded your habitual feelings, you will realize that the momentary battle upon which you are engaged cannot be of such importance as to risk a backward step towards the darkness out of which we have been slowly emerging. Nay, more, if you suffer defeat in your immediate objective, you will be sustained by the same sense of its momentariness that made you unwilling to adopt degrading weapons. You will have, beyond your immediate activities, purposes that are distant and slowly unfolding, in which you are not an isolated individual but one of the great army of those who have led mankind towards a civilized existence. If you have attained to this outlook, a certain deep happiness will never leave you, whatever your personal fate may be. Life will become a communion with the great of all ages, and personal death no more than a negligible incident.

Very similar considerations apply to irreparable sorrows such as the death of some person deeply loved. No good is done to any one by allowing oneself to become sunk in grief on such an occasion. Grief is unavoidable and must be expected, but everything that can be done should be done to minimize it. It is mere sentimentality to aim, as some do, at extracting the very uttermost drop of misery from misfortune. I do not of course deny that a man may be broken by sorrow, but I do say that every man should do his utmost to escape this fate, and should seek any distraction, however trivial, provided it is not in itself harmful or degrading. Among those that I regard as harmful and degrading I include such things as drunkenness and drugs, of which the purpose is to destroy thought, at least for the time being. The proper course is not to destroy thought but to turn it into new channels, or at any rate into channels remote from the present misfortune.

Comradeship makes marriages last, not romanticism. War veterans despise the war they are stuck in. But if asked to leave the battlefield, they will not because of their comrades. The hellish environment created bonds between these men that last throughout their lifetime. Lasting marriages also contains this comradeship. The couple goes through this hurricane of life and by overcoming the difficulties thrown at them, it makes their bond cemented even more.

If you are walking over a chasm on a narrow plank, you are much more likely to fall if you feel fear than if you do not. And the same thing applies to the conduct of life. The fearless man may of course meet with sudden disaster, but it is likely that he will pass unscathed through many difficult situations in which a timid man would come to grief. This useful kind of self-confidence has of course innumerable forms. One man is confident on mountains, another on the sea, and yet another in the air. But general self-confidence towards life comes more than anything else from being accustomed to receive as much of the right sort of affection as one has need for.

The secret to interesting people is that they find interest in almost everything. What do YOU do? Sit and surf the Internet? No, remember the order of Live, Laugh, and Love. 99% of problems come from people mixing up the order, going for Laugh before Live, or Love before Laugh. Instead of focusing on girls to get a life, get a life and love will attend to itself.

DON'T be sweet. LISTEN to her and add in your thoughts (don't try to FIX her problems, UNDERSTAND them). When a trait or feeling comes up that you agree with, don't hesitate to tell her. She will feel a 'connection' with you and her interest level will rise. If she ever makes you mad, tell her EXACTLY WHY YOU'RE MAD. Amazingly, girls LOVE IT when guys will ***** at them because girls want HONESTY and DIRECTNESS. Many girls will put up a 'test' of standing you up just to see if you will swallow it like a 'nice guy' or if you will have the STRENGTH to put them in their place (Women are not attracted to guys they can control).

Now if you want to get a point across to a chick, perhaps a chick misjudged a trait of you, you play the Womanese back to them. If the chick is snobby or thinks you go for any chick, start telling a story that has obviously no point, no purpose, except that it involves women interested in you with you REJECTING them. “Pook! This is madness!” No, it is Womanese. Do not BLURT things, it destroys mystery. Listen to guys who want to try to impress women. Now listen to guys who are Don Juans. The Don Juan will use stories rather then statements, even parables instead of declarations.

The Secret to Womanese is that it is a passage of feelings (where with REAL language it is a passage of thought). Women do not listen to each other, they FEEL one another. They cheer one another up. See those phone lines that are on fire due to women getting home from dates and calling each other? Female gossip is female therapy. As soon as they walk out of class, they must call someone on their cell phone immediately.

Finance: Traits Of Successful People I’ve Met I've met my share of millionaires and successful entrepreneurs. Is there something unique about their characters? Here's what I've observed. EVERY successful person I've met contains these two qualities: 1) They work very hard at what they do (and easily put in the time to do it). 2) They LOVE what they do (so it doesn't seem like work). But's let's look deeper then this, shall we? Trends They seem to be very aware of trends. And I don't mean fashion trends. I mean demigraphic trends and technological trends. For example, Japan will be decreasing in population. America will be increasing in population. Understanding the trends mean investing in real estate in Japan may not be wise while investing in real estate in America might be wise. I have a friend who does nothing but notices a new trend, build a good solid business in that trend, and sell the company for big bucks while that trend is hot. He then moves on to the next trend. Example: Years and years ago, when hand held pcs were very much a novelty, he created a business in it and when the industry took off, he sold his business. He'll find the next trend, and start another business. Millionaire at 26. Not bad! Bill Gates made his fortune through trends. Altair (sp?) was developing the first home pc and Gates called them to sell his Operating System (which he hadn't even written). He ends up buying one from someone else and puts himself into the trend of operating systems for home pcs. What's also important about trends is realizing the BAD trends. If you make a business in a bad trend, you can do everything right and have the market shrink into oblivion. I mean, you don't go selling horse and buggies when cars are coming from the assembly line. Communication Money seems to be attracted to the communicators. I've never met any successful person who didn't have excellent communication skills. And I don't necessarily mean sales skills. What I think is at the heart of this skill is not HOW they say things or how ENERGETIC they are. Rather, it is an acute awareness of human nature. They KNOW how the other person is thinking and shift their presentation to reflect it. This goes to making something the customers want to getting investors to invest in you. St. Augustine had a saying that the best way to win a debate is to know the opponent's position better than the opponent! (Those who get the women also are the communicators.) 245

Do not underestimate the fairer sex. Women are more likely, then men, to use you for sex or for anything else. They manipulate men through their vanity. A humble man is invincible against women.

Compare the above to Don Juan. Many foolishly think the Don Juan is the ‘celebrity’ with women and that female strangers will instantly respond to you on the street, on the elevator, or wherever. This is a silly life, as all these strangers will never really give a damn about you (as you start to do stranger and stranger things to fit into the ‘persona’). Don’t forget your own community. Rather than go for ‘instant hook-ups’ at bars and clubs, try expanding your social circle. Eventually, you’ll get circles and larger circles and even larger circles of women coming after you. These ladies will tell their lady friends about you and the effect just ripples. Even BondJamesBond admits to doing this. This increasing of social circle, of your community, is far far more rewarding than being an introvert who practically costumes his physical appearance, his social self, his emotional self, and (dare I say) his spiritual self for some dumb female stranger who wouldn’t care if he 254 dropped dead the next day! Don Juaning is easy when it’s a way of life.

Don juan or not don juan? Since people drift towards less pain rather than more pain, it follows that they would rather create a mental world where they would be RIGHT to not don juan. "I'm not her type." "This is not a good time." "She wouldn't like me." “All women here have diseases.” This is how we guys get detached from reality into a mental womb.

Waste time and time will waste you. I want you to consider something… that the real world does not exist… that there is only *your* world. Matter is formless and can only be created through form. To live is to form. Once a man has embraced his sexuality, it is then that he creates woman. Your desire is the spirit that brings women to life in your world.

The clue is the phrase “strength of the relationship between the methods and data of a class and some unifying purpose or concept”. This is what we’re aiming at. A cohesive class is one in which its contents are unified around some concept. Maybe we could call this a “responsibility”, but I like to use words in the right way, since words have, you know, meaning and stuff.

The reason is not because we miscounted responsibilities. It’s because our design of a “bunch of small single purpose classes” lacked cohesion. None of the classes we created represents a full concept, based on the current definition of those concepts. Creating a wrestler is not complex, so why did we make it that way?

We could’ve prevented this with two simple questions: Does the method implement a complete concept? If yes, don’t touch it. Does the proposed change affect cohesion? If not, the change is fine as it is. In our case, the original code was short and cohesive; it implemented the entirety of wrestler creation. The change to send an email didn’t affect its cohesion, so we should’ve just done that.

If you think your code is cohesive, don’t mess with it! If it’s not, refactor it so that it is. But when discussing what to do, stay close to the code and the problem it solves. Avoid making a decision by counting things. When you think about cohesion, understand that this is rooted in the concepts of your business domain and not about the code. Code can’t be cohesive just on its own. It has to have the context of the domain. And when that context changes, the code might suddenly lose cohesion!

What’s really going on with DRY is that you should avoid situations where you have to make the same change multiple times. However, even this can lead to problematic outcomes, because our test code often must duplicate some logic of our real code. If we overly “DRY up” our test code, we are left with tests woefully coupled to the code they are testing. This can result in tests that don’t fail when the code under test is broken.

If we overly “DRY up” our test code, we are left with tests woefully coupled to the code they are testing. This can result in tests that don’t fail when the code under test is broken. Instead of yelling “DRY” in a code review, we should be talking about the cost of a particular duplication and being clear what it is. For example, when thinking about data in a database, there should be a single authoritative representation of a fact in the system, but there can be (and often must be) several non-authoritative representations such as caches. That is duplication. That is a form of “repeating yourself”, but it is necessary.

“No! You should find the groove before you start playing. It doesn’t matter whether you know the song or not. If you need to, let a few measures go by while you figure out what the groove is saying. Once you find the groove, it doesn’t matter what note comes out; it will ‘feel’ right to the listener. People generally feel Music before they listen to it anyway. If finding the key is so important to you, at least find it while you groove.”

“Now listen,” he instructed as he walked over to my cheap electronic keyboard. "There are how many notes in Western Music?”     “Twelve,” I answered.     “How many notes are there in most of the key signatures we play in?”     “Seven.”     “Correct. In any key, there are seven so-called ‘right’ notes which leave only five so-called ‘wrong’ notes. What this means is even if we don’t know what key we are in and guess which note to play, we will be ‘right’ more than half the time.

"This is liberating, is it not?” he remarked. "The real beauty is this: If you use your ears and listen to that accidental note, you may find that it actually sounds better than the ‘right’ note you intended to play.”     He walked back over to the guitar and started playing a simple groove. He looked at me, talking while he played.     “Don’t be afraid of the notes; jump right in. All I want you to do is listen to whether the note is in the key or not. Just think ‘in’ or ‘out.’ If the note is ‘in,’ listen to it and realize where you are in relationship to the root. If the note is ‘out,’ slide your finger one fret in either direction, and voila, you are right again.”     I picked up my bass and, without thinking, played the first note my finger landed on. It sounded horrible, so I quickly slid my finger down one fret. Michael was correct, I was now on a ‘right’ note, and it sounded good. I wanted to test his theory, so I played the same wrong note again, but this time, I slid my finger up one fret. Like before, I was on a ‘right’ note. It made me smile.

Another exercise involved playing notes randomly, without thinking of what I was going to play first. “Just play any note,” he instructed. “Jump all over the bass as if you don’t care.” I was surprised at how hard it was to do. I had a difficult time not playing patterns. My fingers kept landing on top of the frets instead of in between them.     “Mistakes,” he told me, “are just things we didn’t mean to play. It doesn’t mean they are ‘wrong.’ Some of the best Music I’ve ever played started out as a mistake. Mistakes usually throw us off because the note comes out before we think about it. We can’t avoid making mistakes, but we can get comfortable with them, especially if we practice making them.”     The thought of practicing mistakes was another strange but interesting idea. I had no idea how I was supposed to practice that. Michael answered my thought.     "This ‘random’ exercise simulates making mistakes so that they no longer affect us negatively. If we learn to play random notes cleanly, playing any pre-thought note or pattern will be a piece of cake.”

Although you may never have even thought about it, your brain has already constructed an internal system for making decisions. This system acts like an invisible force, directing all of your thoughts, actions, and feelings, both good and bad, every moment that you live. It controls how you evaluate everything in your life, and it’s largely driven by your subconscious mind. The scary thing is that most people never consciously set this system up. Instead, it’s been installed through the years by sources as diverse as parents, peers, teachers, television, advertisers, and the culture at large. This system is comprised of five components: 1) your core beliefs and unconscious rules, 2) your life values, 3) your references, 4) the habitual questions that you ask yourself, and 5) the emotional states you experience in each moment. The synergistic relationship of these five elements exerts a force that’s responsible for prompting you to or stopping you from taking action, causing you to anticipate or worry about the future, making you feel loved or rejected, and dictating your level of success and happiness. It determines why you do what you do and why you don’t do some things that you know you need to do.

On a more personal, everyday level, individuals who follow intense physical regimens in order to sculpt their bodies have learned to link tremendous feelings of pleasure to the “pain” of physical exertion.

We need to remember that most of our beliefs are generalizations about our past, based on our interpretations of painful and pleasurable experiences. The challenge is threefold: 1) most of us do not consciously decide what we’re going to believe; 2) often our beliefs are based on misinterpretation of past experiences; and 3) once we adopt a belief, we forget it’s merely an interpretation. We begin to treat our beliefs as if they’re realities, as if they are gospel. In fact, we rarely, if ever, question our long-held beliefs. If you ever wonder why people do what they do, again, you need to remember that human beings are not random creatures: all of our actions are the result of our beliefs. Whatever we do, it is out of our conscious or unconscious beliefs about what will lead to pleasure or away from pain. If you want to create long-term and consistent changes in your behaviors, you must change the beliefs that are holding you back.

What are some of the reference experiences you’ve had? Maybe men and women have told you that you’re sexy. Or maybe you look at yourself in the mirror, compare your image to that of those whom other people consider sexy, and say, “Hey, I look like them!” Or maybe strangers on the street call out and wave to you. All these experiences mean nothing until you organize them under the idea that you’re sexy. As you do this, the legs make you feel solid about the idea and cause you to begin to believe it.

The emotional intensity we feel about any of these references will definitely affect the strength and width of the leg. The strongest and most solid legs are formed by personal experiences that we have a lot of emotion attached to because they were painful or pleasurable experiences.

I was exposed to a series of technologies that could make changes in people’s lives with lightning-like speed: simple technologies like Gestalt therapy, and tools of influence like Ericksonian hypnosis and Neuro-Linguistic Programming. When I saw that these tools could really help people create changes in minutes that previously took months, years, or decades to achieve, I became an evangelist in my approach to them. I decided to commit all of my resources to mastering these technologies. And I didn’t stop there: as soon as I learned something, I applied it immediately. I’ll never forget my first week of training in Neuro-Linguistic Programming. We learned things like how to eliminate a lifetime phobia in less than an hour—something that through many forms of traditional therapy could take as much as five years or more! On the fifth day, I turned to the psychologists and psychiatrists in the class and said, “Hey, guys, let’s find some phobies and cure them!” They all looked at me like I was crazy. They made it very clear to me that I obviously wasn’t an educated man, that we had to wait until the six-month certification program was completed, go through a testing procedure, and if we were successful, only then would we be ready to use this material! I wasn’t willing to wait. So I launched my career by appearing on radio and television programs throughout Canada and eventually the United States as well. In each of these, I talked to people about these technologies for creating change and made it clear that if we wanted to change our lives, whether it was a disempowering habit or a phobia that had been controlling us for years, that behavior or that emotional pattern could be changed in a matter of minutes, even though they might have tried to change it for years previously. Was this a radical concept? You bet. But I passionately argued that all changes are created in a moment. It’s just that most of us wait until certain things happen before we finally decide to make a shift. If we truly understood how the brain worked, I argued, we could stop the endless process of analyzing why things had happened to us, and if we could just simply change what we linked pain and pleasure to, we could just as easily change the way our nervous systems had been conditioned and take charge of our lives immediately. As you can imagine, a young kid with no Ph.D. who was making these controversial claims on the radio didn’t go over very well with some traditionally trained mental-health professionals. A few psychiatrists and psychologists attacked me, some on the air. So I learned to build my career in changing people on two principles: technology and challenge. I knew I had a superior technology, a superior way of creating change based on crucial understandings of human behavior that most traditional

What are the two changes everyone wants in life? Isn’t it true that we all want to change either 1) how we feel about things or 2) our behaviors? If a person has been through a tragedy—they were abused as a child, they were raped, lost a loved one, are lacking in self-esteem—this person clearly will remain in pain until the sensations they link to themselves, these events, or situations are changed. Likewise, if a person overeats, drinks, smokes, or takes drugs, they have a set of behaviors that must change. The only way this can happen is by linking pain to the old behavior and pleasure to a new behavior.

there are three specific beliefs about responsibility that a person must have if they’re going to create long-term change: 1) First, we must believe, “Something must change”—not that it should change, not that it could or ought to, but that it absolutely must. So often I hear people say, “This weight should come off,” “Procrastinating is a lousy habit,” “My relationships should be better,” But you know, we can “should” all over ourselves, and our life still won’t change! It’s only when something becomes a must that we begin the process of truly doing what’s necessary to shift the quality of our lives. 2) Second, we must not only believe that things must change, but we must believe, “I must change it.” We must see ourselves as the source of the change. Otherwise, we’ll always be looking for someone else to make the changes for us, and we’ll always have someone else to blame when it doesn’t work out. We must be the source of our change if our change is going to last. 3) Third, we have to believe, “I can change it.” Without believing that it’s possible for us to change, as we’ve already discussed in the last chapter, we stand no chance of carrying through on our desires.

why would someone not change when they feel and know that they should? They associate more pain to making the change than to not changing. To change someone, including ourselves, we must simply reverse this so that not changing is incredibly painful (painful beyond our threshold of tolerance), and the idea of changing is attractive and pleasurable! To get true leverage, ask yourself pain-inducing questions: “What will this cost me if I don’t change?”

If you overeat on a regular basis and want to stop, I’ll give you a technique that will definitely work, if you’re willing to commit to it. The next time you find yourself in a restaurant overeating, jump up in the middle of the room, point at your own chair and scream at the top of your lungs, “PIG!” I guarantee that if you do this three or four times in a public place, you won’t overeat anymore! You’ll link too much pain to this behavior! Just remember: the more outrageous your approach to breaking a pattern, the more effective it will be.

A simple example of this occurred with my daughter Jolie’s ex-boyfriend. Jolie was very busy with school, dance, and a play she was in. He wanted her to call him every single day, and when she missed a few days and then called him, he gave her tremendous amounts of pain. He clearly wanted her to call more frequently, yet his strategy for reinforcement was to badger and berate her when she did call. Have you ever been guilty of this? If you want your boyfriend, girlfriend, spouse, or significant other to call you more often, how effective do you think it would be to nag them to call? When they finally do call, do you greet them with statements like, “Oh, so you finally picked up the phone! Will wonders never cease? Why do I always have to be the one who makes the call?” What you’re doing is training him or her not to call you! You’re giving pain right after they do the very thing you want. What will happen as a result of this? Pain will be linked to calling you; he or she will avoid it even more in the future. In Jolie’s case, this pattern was continuous, going on for months until Jolie felt that she couldn’t win. If she didn’t call, she’d get pain. If she did call, she’d get pain. As you might guess, this pattern of negative reinforcement permeated many aspects of their relationship and, eventually, the relationship ended.

Remember, link pleasure to any behavior you want someone to repeat.

The most important thing to remember about conditioning, however, is to reinforce the desired behavior immediately. The minute you find yourself responding playfully to what used to frustrate you, reinforce yourself. Do it again and create even more pleasure. Laugh a bit. Remember, each time you create a strong emotional feeling, either positive or negative, you’re creating a connection in your nervous system. If you’ll repeat that pattern again and again, visualizing the same imagery that makes you feel strong or makes you laugh, you’ll find it easier to be strong or to laugh in the future. The pattern will be well established.

The six steps of NAC can be used for anything: challenges with relationships, problems in business, being stuck in a pattern of yelling at your children. Let’s say you worry too much about things over which you have no control. How can you use the six steps to change this disempowering pattern? 1) Ask yourself, “What do I want to do instead of worry?” 2) Get leverage on yourself and realize what worry does to destroy your life. Bring it to a threshold; see what it would cost you ultimately in your life so that you’re not willing to pay that price anymore. Imagine the joy of getting this monkey off your back and being truly free once and for all! “Hey, bucko … I’m through begging.”   3) Interrupt the pattern! Every time you worry, break the pattern by being totally outrageous. Stick your finger up your nose, or belt out “Oh, What a Beautiful Morning!” at the top of your lungs. 4) Create an empowering alternative. What will you do instead of worry? Pull out your journal and write down a plan of what you can do immediately instead. Maybe you can go for a run, and while you’re running, you can think of new solutions. 5) Condition the new pattern; vividly imagine and rehearse this new pattern with tremendous emotional intensity and repetition until this new thought, behavior or emotional pattern is automatic. Reinforce yourself by taking the first step: see yourself succeding again and again. Seeing the results in advance can give you the pleasure you desire. Again, use repetition and emotional intensity to condition the new pattern until it’s consistent. 6) Test it and see if it works. Think about the situation that used to worry you, and see that you no longer worry in this situation.

I practiced over and over his physical movements identically with tremendous emotional intensity, sending my brain deep sensations of certainty. And all the while, my instructor coached me on my movements. Bam! I broke through one piece of wood, then two pieces, then three pieces, then four. What had I done to accomplish this? 1) I raised my standards and made breaking the wood a must—something I previously would have accepted as a limitation; 2) I changed my limiting belief about my ability to do this by changing my emotional state into one of certainty, and 3) I modeled an effective strategy for producing the result.

My definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel tons of pleasure and very little pain—and because of your lifestyle, have the people around you feel a lot more pleasure than they do pain. Someone who’s achieved a lot but is living in emotional pain all the time, or is surrounded by people in pain all the time, isn’t truly successful. The fourth goal is to enable others to change their state instantly, to change their state in any environment, and to change their state for their whole life. This is what my franchisees learn to be able to do in their seminars and in their one-on-one work with people. So, what do you need to remember from this chapter? All that you really want in life is to change how you feel. Again, all your emotions are nothing but biochemical storms in your brain, and you are in control of them at any moment in time. You can feel ecstasy right now, or you can feel pain or depression or overwhelmed—it’s all up to you. You don’t need drugs or anything else to do it. There are much more effective ways and, as you learned in the chapter on beliefs, drugs can be overpowered by the chemicals you create in your own body, by changing your focus and the way you’re using your physiology. These chemicals are much more powerful than virtually any outside substance.   “Every great and commanding moment in the annals of the world is the triumph of some enthusiasm.” —RALPH WALDO EMERSON   DO YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE YOURSELF FEEL GOOD?   On a business trip to Toronto, I felt physically stressed because of intense back pain. As the plane descended, I began to think about what I needed to do when I got to my hotel. It would already be 10:30 P.M., and I had to be up early the next morning to conduct my seminar. I could eat something—after all, I’d had nothing all day—but it was awfully late. I could do my paperwork and watch the news. In that moment I realized all of these actions were merely strategies for getting out of pain and into some level of pleasure. Yet none of them were all that compelling. I needed to expand my list of ways to experience pleasure, regardless of the time or place. So do you know how to make yourself feel good? This sounds like a stupid question, doesn’t it? But really, do you have a set of specific and empowering ways to make yourself feel good at a moment’s notice? Can you accomplish this without the use of food, alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, or other addictive sources? I’m sure you have a few, but let’s expand the list. Right now, let’s identify some of the positive choices you already have for making yourself feel good. Sit down right now and write down a list of things that you currently do to change how you feel. As long as you’re making a list, why not add some new things you may not have tried before that could positively change your state as well? Don’t stop until you have a minimum of fifteen ways to instantly feel good, and the ideal would be at least twenty-five. This is an exercise you may want to come back to again until you have hundreds of ways! When I made a list for myself, I realized that playing music was one of the most powerful ways I could change my state quickly. Reading was another way to feel good because it changed my focus, and I love to learn—especially reading something instructional and informational, something I can immediately apply to my life. Changing my body movements is something I can do instantly to break out of a limiting state and into a resourceful one: exercising on my StairMaster™ with the music cranking full tilt, jumping up and down on my rebounder unit, running five miles uphill, swimming laps. Here are some others: dancing, singing along with my favorite CDs, watching a comedy film, going to a concert, listening to informational audio tapes. Taking a Jacuzzi, a warm bath. Making love with my wife. Having a family dinner where we all sit down at the table and chat about what’s most important to us.

There’s a big difference between an affirmation and a question. When you say to yourself, “I’m happy; I’m happy; I’m happy,” this might cause you to feel happy if you produce enough emotional intensity, change your physiology and therefore your state. But in reality, you can make affirmations all day long and not really change how you feel. What will really change the way you feel is asking, “What am I happy about now? What could I be happy about if I wanted to be? How would that make me feel?” If you keep asking questions like this, you’ll come up with real references that will make you begin to focus on reasons that do in fact exist for you to feel happy. You’ll feel certain that you’re happy.

THE MORNING POWER QUESTIONS Our life experience is based on what we focus on. The following questions are designed to cause you to experience more happiness, excitement, pride, gratitude, joy, commitment, and love every day of your life. Remember, quality questions create a quality life. Come up with two or three answers to all of these questions and feel fully associated. If you have difficulty discovering an answer simply add the word “could.” Example: “What could I be most happy about in my life now?” What am I happy about in my life now? What about that makes me happy? How does that make me feel? What am I excited about in my life now? What about that makes me excited? How does that make me feel? What am I proud about in my life now? What about that makes me proud? How does that make me feel? What am I grateful about in my life now? What about that makes me grateful? How does that make me feel? What am I enjoying most in my life right now? What about that do I enjoy? How does that make me feel? What am I committed to in my life right now? What about that makes me committed? How does that make me feel? Who do I love? Who loves me? What about that makes me loving? How does that make me feel? In the evening, sometimes I ask the Morning Questions, and sometimes I ask an additional three questions. Here they are: THE EVENING POWER QUESTIONS What have I given today? In what ways have I been a giver today? What did I learn today? How has today added to the quality of my life or how can I use today as an investment in my future? Repeat the Morning Questions (optional).

What are some questions that would be useful for you to ask of yourself on a regular basis? I know two of my favorite are the most simple. They help me to turn around any challenges that may come up in my life. They are simply, “What’s great about this?” and “How can I use this?” By asking what’s great about any situation, I usually find some powerful, positive meaning, and by asking how I can use it, I can take any challenge and turn it into a benefit.

You and I must realize that the English language is filled with words that, in addition to their literal meanings, convey distinct emotional intensity. For example, if you develop a habit of saying you “hate” things—you “hate” your hair; you “hate” your job; you “hate” having to do something—do you think this raises the intensity of your negative emotional states more than if you were to use a phrase like “I prefer something else”?

For example, some Native American languages have no word for “lie”—that concept is simply not a part of their language. Nor is it a part of their thinking or behavior.

Can you see how changing just one global metaphor from “Life is a competition” to “Life is a game” could instantly change your experience of life in many areas simultaneously? Would it change your relationships if you saw life as a dance? Could it change the way you operate in your business? You bet it could! This is an example of a pivot point, a global change, where just making this one change would transform the way you think and feel in multiple areas of your life.

What are some of the metaphors people have for their personal relationships? Some people call the person they’re in a relationship with “the old man” or “the old hag.” Some call them “the dictator,” “the ball and chain,” “the warden.” One woman actually called her husband “the Prince of Darkness”! What are some more empowering alternatives? Many people call their mate their “lover,” their “better half,” their “partner in life,” their “teammate,” their “soul mate.” By the way, even changing one slight nuance of a metaphor will change the way you perceive the relationship. You may not feel passionate for a “partner,” but you certainly would for your “lover.”

So try the following exercise: 1. What is life? Write down the metaphors you’ve already chosen: “Life is like …” what? Brainstorm everything you can think of, because you probably have more than one metaphor for life. When you’re in an unresourceful state, you probably call it a battle or a war, and when you’re in a good state, maybe you think of it as a gift. Write them all down. Then review your list and ask yourself, “If life is such and such, what does it mean to me?” If life is sacred, what does that mean? If life is a dream, what does that mean? If all the world is a stage, what does that mean? Each of your metaphors empower and limit. “All the world’s a stage” may be great because it means you can go out there and make a difference and be heard. But it also may mean you’re someone who’s always performing, instead of sharing your true feelings. So take a good look at the metaphors that you’ve made available to yourself. What are their advantages and disadvantages? What new metaphors might you like to apply to your life in order to feel more happy, free, and empowered? 2. Make a list of all the metaphors that you link to relationships or marriage. Are they empowering or disempowering? Remember, conscious awareness alone can transform your metaphors, because your brain starts to say, “That doesn’t work—that’s ridiculous!” And you can adopt a new metaphor easily. The beauty of this technology is that it’s so simple. 3. Pick another area of your life that impacts you most—whether it’s your business, your parents, your children, your ability to learn—and discover your metaphors for this area. Write these metaphors down and study their impact. Write down, “Learning is like playing.” If studying is like “pulling teeth,” you can imagine the pain you’re giving yourself! This might be a good metaphor to change, and change now! Once again, notice the positive and negative consequences of each of your metaphors. Exploring them can create new choices for your life. 4. Create new, more empowering metaphors for each of these areas. Decide that from now on you’re going to think of life as four or five new things to start with, at least. Life is not a war. Life is not a test. Life is a game, life is a dance, life is sacred, life is a gift, life is a picnic—whatever creates the most positive emotional intensity for you. 5. Finally, decide that you are going to live with these new, empowering metaphors for the next thirty days.

CONFIDENCE. Unshakable confidence is the sense of certainty we all want. The only way you can consistently experience confidence, even in environments and situations you’ve never previously encountered, is through the power of faith. Imagine and feel certain about the emotions you deserve to have now, rather than wait for them to spontaneously appear someday in the far distant future. When you’re confident, you’re willing to experiment, to put yourself on the line. One way to develop faith and confidence is simply to practice using it. If I were to ask whether you’re confident that you can tie your own shoes, I’m sure you could tell me with perfect confidence that you can. Why? Only because you’ve done it thousands of times! So practice confidence by using it consistently, and you’ll be amazed at the dividends it reaps in every area of your life. In order to get yourself to do anything, it’s imperative to exercise confidence rather than fear. The tragedy of many people’s lives is that they avoid doing things because they’re afraid; they even feel bad about things in advance. But remember: the source of success for outstanding achievers often finds its origin in a set of nurtured beliefs for which that individual had no references! The ability to act on faith is what moves the human race forward.

What I hope you’ll take from this chapter is an appreciation of all your emotions and a sense of excitement that they’re all providing you with a chance to learn something to make your life better, literally at a moment’s notice. Never again do you need to feel that painful emotions are your enemies. They’re all here to serve you as a signal that some kind of change is needed. As you refine your ability to use these Action Signals, you’ll start handling them up front, when they are small, rather than waiting until they turn into full-blown crises. For instance, you’ll handle a situation while it’s still annoying, not infuriating—like handling a weight problem when you notice the first extra pound rather than waiting until you’ve added another thirty. Over the next couple of weeks, focus on enjoying the process of learning from all of your emotions. You can experience the whole kaleidoscope at any moment you choose. Don’t be afraid—ride the roller coaster! Experience the joy, passion, and thrill of all the emotions, and know that you’re in control! It’s your life, your emotions, your destiny.

After that, which usually doesn’t take very long, I pull my attention back inside my mind to where Music is. In other words, I release the technique. I let it go. I detach from it. Once that is done, the technique usually develops rapidly on its own. If it doesn’t, I will give the technique a little more attention. The key is this: I never lose sight of my real agenda, which is to make Music. This is the same method I use for talking. Rarely do I ever think about talking technique; I just talk.”

“Whether we are talking about Music or Life, good technique is important. Understand that just learning techniques is not enough. You must make a choice, a conscious choice to take one road or another. Good or bad, each is narrow, making it difficult for U-turns.     “Know that the mind is a powerful tool, and that its power can respond to you both positively or negatively. Learning to use it completely should not be taken lightly. This is where technique as well as intention and attention come into play. Many people have gotten sucked into the black hole of the mind, never to return again.”

“In 1968,” Michael continued, “in order to prevent a riot, President Johnson called upon James Brown, a musician, to address the public after Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Mr. Brown, speaking to the masses, was able to do what no politician could; he calmed them. After that, James Brown stated that he was perceived by the government as the most dangerous man in the world. Because he did what he was asked to do, he was under close surveillance for a long time. The government felt that if he could easily stop a riot, he must easily be able to start one. Think about that. James Brown, an entertainer, was able to alter thousands of people’s emotions. How did he do it? It is fascinating to think about.”

Michael told me to stand up and position myself about ten feet away from the stereo speakers. He said that I should stand at that close distance so I wouldn’t get my emotions confused. I had no idea what he was talking about. Then he told me to turn away from the speakers, raise my right hand to about chest level, and face my palm out away from me. He placed a CD in the player and pressed play. It was Curtis Mayfield.     “What I want you to do,” he instructed, “is slowly turn around in a complete circle. Pay attention to what you feel in your palms when you face the Music versus when you don’t.”     I did exactly as he asked. Now let’s cut to the chase here. It worked! I felt a difference! I was shocked, and I am still shocked every time I share this exercise with someone. It works! And on my first try, as soon as I faced the speakers, I could feel a slight tingling sensation in my palm. It was faint, but I could feel it. I wasn’t sure at first, if I was just feeling the actual sound waves coming from the speakers or the energy, but I could feel something.     As if reading my thoughts, Michael kept the music playing but completely turned down the volume. He asked me to repeat the exercise. He said that turning down the volume would assure me that I was feeling the emotions from the music and not the vibrations from the speakers.     It was harder to feel this time. I think my mind got in the way. It usually does after the first success, but I could still feel it, and it surprised me.     “Wow, what was that?” I asked. I was like a little boy on Christmas morning, my mouth wide open in shock.     “Emotion, Energy, Vibration, Life, Love, Music, call it what you want,” he answered. "The fact that you could feel it, even when you couldn’t hear it, is what’s important. You now know that something is there.”     “It was faint, but I felt it. I know that I did,” I exclaimed, my voice revealing my excitement.     Michael spoke softly as he explained. “When vibrations are coming out faintly from an object, like speakers for instance, our first reaction may be to turn up the volume. Another approach would be to turn up our own volume, our receiving volume.     “We can turn up and down what we receive at any time. Married couples do it all the time, hearing only what they choose to hear and when they choose to hear it. This situation is similar. You adjust your own dynamics in situations when you cannot, or choose not to, adjust the dynamics of the other object.”     His talk of vibrations always seemed to confuse me a bit. Even though he was now using the word dynamics, my confusion let me know that he was also talking about vibrations.

Fourth, surround yourself with role models and those who can help you develop a plan that will guide you in making it all real. Each of these steps will help you to program your RAS and sensitize you to all the possible resources you can incorporate to bring your goals to fruition.

We need to practice this same approach in weeding the gardens of our minds. We have to be able to notice when we start to have a negative pattern—not beat ourselves up about it, and not dwell on it—but simply break the patterns as quickly as we discover them, and replace them with the new seeds of mental, emotional, physical, financial, spiritual, and professional success. How do we break these patterns when they show up? Simply remember the steps of NAC you learned in Chapter 6. 1) You need to decide what you do want. If you really want to feel a sense of passion, joy, and control over your life—which obviously you must, or you wouldn’t be reading this now—then you know what you want. 2) You’ve got to get leverage on yourself. If you read this whole book and don’t establish any new patterns, wouldn’t that be an unbelievable waste of time? In contrast, how will you feel as you truly use what you’ve learned to take immediate control of your mind, body, emotions, finances, and relationships? Let your desire to avoid pain and induce massive pleasure drive you to make the changes necessary to take your life to the next level now. In order to accomplish this, you must … 3) Interrupt the limiting pattern. The best way I know to do this is to simply go on a “Mental Diet”—that is, take a set period of time and take conscious control of all your thoughts. A Mental Diet is an opportunity to eliminate the negative and destructive patterns of thinking and feeling that inevitably come from living life in an emotionally reactionary and mentally undisciplined fashion. I committed myself to such a mental cleansing almost eight years ago, and found it to be a very profound and invaluable process. I came across the idea in a small pamphlet by Emmet Fox.* In it, he expounded upon the value of spending seven days without ever holding a negative thought. The idea seemed so Pollyanna, so ridiculously simple, that at first I thought the whole concept was a total waste of time. But as he began to lay out the rules of this diet he was prescribing to cleanse the mental system, I began to realize it might be more difficult than I thought. The challenge intrigued me, and the final results astounded me. I’d like to broaden the challenge Mr. Fox created in 1935 and expand it as a tool that can help you integrate the master tools of change that you’ve been learning thus far in this book, beginning today. Here’s your opportunity now to really apply all the new disciplines you’ve learned in the previous chapters. My challenge to you is simply this: For the next ten days, beginning immediately,

THE TEN-DAY MENTAL CHALLENGE—RULES OF THE GAME Rule 1. In the next ten consecutive days, refuse to dwell on any unresourceful thoughts or feelings. Refuse to indulge in any disempowering questions or devitalizing vocabulary or metaphors. Rule 2. When you catch yourself beginning to focus on the negative—and you certainly will—you are to immediately use the techniques you’ve learned to redirect your focus toward a better emotional state. Specifically, use the Problem-Solving Questions* as your first line of attack; for example: “What’s great about this? What’s not perfect yet?” Remember, by asking a question like, “What’s not perfect yet?” you’re presupposing that thing will be perfect. This will change your state. It doesn’t ignore the problem, but it keeps you in the right state while you identify what needs to be changed. In addition, set yourself up for success each morning for the next ten days by asking yourself the Morning Power Questions. You can do them before you get out of bed or while you’re in the shower, but make sure you do them right away. This will focus you in the direction of establishing empowering mental and emotional patterns each day as you awake. In the evening, use the Evening Power Questions, or any questions you believe will put you in a great state before you drop off to sleep. Rule 3. For the next ten consecutive days, make certain that your whole focus in life is on solutions and not on problems. The minute you see a possible challenge, immediately focus on what the solution could be. Rule 4. If you backslide—that is, if you catch yourself indulging in or dwelling on an unresourceful thought or feeling—don’t beat yourself up. There’s no problem with this as long as you change immediately. However, if you continue to dwell on unresourceful thoughts or feelings for any measurable length of time, you must wait until the following morning and start the ten days over. The goal of this program is ten consecutive days without holding or dwelling on a negative thought. This starting-over process must happen no matter how many days in a row you’ve already accomplished the task.

It's important to note that if you think about doing any of these things as a technique to increase intimacy you'll be in your head and the feeling of the interaction will be awkward. Instead, let these examples serve as a reminder to not hold back your own physical expression in the interactions that make you the most nervous.

These men wait for the “perfect moment,” which ends up never coming. They will end up dating a woman those rare times when she makes it easy for him and initially displays her desire aggressively, but they'll never feel like they’re with a woman because they chose her and will often feel like they’re settling, not necessarily with the woman but with themselves because they know they have yet to overcome the fear of expressing their sexuality.

If, for whatever reason, either one of you is uncomfortable proceeding to deeper levels of physical intimacy in that moment, then it's time to place a momentary hold on allowing the physical polarity to intensify and instead enjoy swimming around in whatever level of intimacy you're both comfortable with. If either of you becomes frustrated when the other expresses his or her boundaries, it's typically a sign that you had some agenda or preconceived notions about the other person that didn't take his or her feelings into account. In these instances the other person will rightfully feel creeped out and will usually pull away even more. If, on the other hand, both people are simply enjoying the natural attraction between them at a level they're both comfortable with showing that they both care about the other person's feelings, then it becomes increasingly difficult to stop the natural process of physical polarity from continuing. There are some incredibly good reasons to stop things from getting more physical though, even if nature is telling you otherwise: if either of you are in an exclusive relationship, if it would hurt a friend,

What determines whether you ask somebody out for a date? Your evaluations are deeply affected by the specific question you ask yourself as you consider approaching this person. If you ask yourself a question like “Wouldn’t it be great to get to know this person?”, you’re likely to feel motivated to approach them. If, however, you habitually ask questions like “What if they reject me? What if they’re offended when I approach them? What if I get hurt?” then obviously these questions will lead you through a set of evaluations that result in your passing up the opportunity to connect with someone you’re truly interested in.

“Even though the drums are not playing,” he told me, “the pulse is still there. You gotta grab onto that pulse as quickly as you can and lock it into your body. It’s really important that you do that. Then you’ll feel where you need to be at all times.”     I knew what he was talking about. When playing with a good drummer, the pulse can easily be felt. Even though different drummers have different pulses, I still agreed with Sam. If I was really “in the groove,” I would definitely be able to feel the pulse.     "Now I’ll make it just a little bit harder,” he said. "This will tell us how ‘locked in’ you really are.”     He changed the drum machine once more. There were still four measures playing, but there was an audible beat programmed to play on beat one only. I only had one beat out of sixteen to grasp the tempo. He can’t be serious, I thought. He was. A bit intimidated, I closed my eyes and listened closely.     To my surprise, I could do it. I could still feel the pulse and I locked in to it. It was a little strange. Even though there was no audible pulse playing, I could definitely feel it. With just one beat to go on, I kept perfect time for the next fifteen beats. I was so happy that I felt like doing three cartwheels myself. I opened my eyes to find Sam fiddling with the drum machine once again. He changed it back to the original program consisting of four complete patterns.

I recommend that before you begin, have photographs taken that show your physique from all four sides. Write down all your important measurements—neck, chest, biceps, forearms, wrists, waist, thighs, and calves—as well as your weight. This way you can always check back to find out what kind of progress you have made. Incidentally, if you are embarrassed to have body photos taken because you don’t like your body very much, that is all the more indication of how much bodybuilding can do for you. We all want to look good on the beach, to stand naked in front of a mirror and be pleased with what we see—and, of course, have others be pleased with what they see when they look at us! Why not look good out of clothes as well as in them? You certainly don’t want to take off your clothes and, as my friends “Hans and Franz” would say, set off a “flabberlanch.” As

Remember, it is not how quickly you develop that will finally make the difference, but how far you are able to go. The judges don’t look at competitors onstage and say, “That contestant has been training for eight years but the other one is better because he’s only been training for three!” No, all that counts is how good you get, and you can’t make your body develop any faster than your own biological makeup will allow.

Most bodybuilders are highly competitive individuals, but others are in the sport primarily for the meaning it gives their lives, regardless of whether or not they ever achieve a victory. Bodybuilding is more than a sport, it is also a way of life. It is an entire philosophy of how to live, a value system that gives specific answers to questions that concern so many of us these days—questions of what is worth doing and what value to give to excellence and achievement. It is a way of pursuing self-worth and personal validation, of finding satisfaction in your ability to set goals for yourself and working to reach them. Of course,

For example, both research and experience have shown that bodybuilders get the most results using a weight in each exercise that represents about 70 to 75 percent of their one-rep maximum—that is, the amount of weight they could use doing one full-out repetition of that particular exercise. If you use this amount of weight you will generally find you can do sets of: 8 to 12 repetitions for upper-body muscles; 12 to 16 repetitions for the major leg muscles.

For most purposes, bodybuilding exercises should take any muscle through its longest possible range of motion. (There are some specific exceptions which I’ll talk about later.) You should take care to stretch out to full extension, and then come all the way back to a position of complete contraction. This is the only way to stimulate the entire muscle and every possible muscle fiber. So when I’m suggesting you do 8 reps, or 10 reps or more, in each case I am assuming you are going to be doing full-range-of-motion repetitions.

ENDOMORPH TRAINING Generally, the endomorph will not have too much difficulty building muscle, but will have to be concerned with losing fat weight and then being very careful with diet so as not to gain that weight back. Therefore, for the endomorph I recommend: 1. A higher proportion of high-set, high-repetition training (no lower than the 10- to 12-rep range), with very short rest periods so as to burn off as much fat as possible. Doing a few extra sets of a few extra exercises while you are trying to get lean is a good idea. 2. Additional aerobic exercise such as bicycle riding, running, or some other calorie-consuming activity. Training in the gym burns calories, but not as much as cardio exercise done on a continuous basis for 30 to 45 minutes or more at a time. 3. A low-calorie diet that contains the necessary nutritional balance (see Nutrition and Diet). Not zero anything, but the minimum amount of protein, carbohydrates, and fats, with vitamin and mineral supplements to be certain the body is not being deprived of any essential nutrients.

When you're feeling sexual and speaking in a slower, more sexual tone, your communication will necessarily be laden with more sexual innuendo.

There's few things that are a bigger turnoff to women than guys who are out at the bar desperately prowling for affection. At the same time, there are few things women in a social situation find more attractive than guys who are genuinely enjoying their friends' company and the company of those around them. If you're desperately searching for a partner, you'll scare away anyone who catches a whiff of that desperation. It's when you focus on becoming the best person you can be that someone amazing will come along.

When  you encounter someone who unleashes a flood of chemicals in your brain, you can acknowledge that you feel afraid, or turned on. You can acknowledge that your brain is doing that typical brain thing where it either makes excuses for why you should run or realizing the potential “reward” there and getting over-excited about how to achieve it. With full consciousness of these things you can then say, “I realize I’m having these thoughts and feelings and they’re perfectly normal and natural, the more I embrace these feelings, the more I’ll probably enjoy this interaction. I also know that lingering on the thoughts created by these feelings won’t do me any good, so I’ll let them go and bring my attention back to enjoying connecting with this person in the moment.” In other words, by practicing awareness and staying in the moment, you will teach your brain to create a “shortcut” whereby your frontal lobe will be able to react much faster to whatever is causing your limbic system to go haywire.

So instead of just conditioning yourself to feel differently about rejection and eliminating the fearful behaviors, you can adopt a new global belief that says, “I am the source of all my emotions. Nothing and no one can change how I feel except me. If I find myself in reaction to anything, I can change it in a moment.” If you truly adopt this belief, not intellectually, but emotionally where you feel it with absolute certainty, can you see how that would eliminate not only your fear of rejection, but also your feelings of anger or frustration or inadequacy? Suddenly, you become the master of your fate.

What can we learn from all this? In our personal and professional lives, as well as on the global front, we must get clear about what is most important in our lives and decide that we will live by these values, no matter what happens. This consistency must occur regardless of whether the environment rewards us for living by our standards or not. We must live by our principles even when it “rains on our parade,” even if no one gives us the support we need. The only way for us to have long-term happiness is to live by our highest ideals, to consistently act in acccordance with what we believe our life is truly about.

They’re trying to distract themselves from those empty feelings by filling the gap with the behavior that produces a “quick fix” change of state. This behavior becomes a pattern, and people often focus on changing the behavior itself rather than dealing with the cause. They don’t just have a drinking problem; they have a values problem.

as you learned in Chapter 4, a belief is nothing but a feeling of certainty about what something means. If you believe you are intelligent, it’s because you have activated certain references to support that feeling of certainty. Maybe you’ve had the experience of successfully tackling mental challenges, such as acing a test or running a business well. All of these reference experiences act as “table legs” to support the idea, or “table-top,” that you are intelligent.

Let me ask you again, How do you use your references? Do you consciously interpret them in ways that empower you, in ways that support the achievement of your goals? Or does your brain automatically latch on to individual experiences where you’re not supported, and develop beliefs like “Everybody’s out to get me,” or “Every time I try anything, I get knocked down,” or “I don’t deserve to be loved”? The way we use our references will determine how we feel, because whether something is good or bad is all based on what you’re comparing it to.

Understand: Like everyone, you think you are rational, but you are not. Rationality is not a power you are born with but one you acquire through training and practice. The voice of Athena simply stands for a higher power that exists within you right now, a potential you have perhaps felt in moments of calmness and focus, the perfect idea coming to you after much thinking. You are not connected to this higher power in the present because your mind is weighed down with emotions. Like Pericles in the Assembly, you are infected by all of the drama that others churn up; you are continually reacting to what people give you, experiencing waves of excitement, insecurity, and anxiety that make it hard to focus. Your attention is pulled this way and that, and without the rational standard to guide your decisions, you never quite reach the goals that you set. At any moment this can change with a simple decision—to cultivate your inner Athena. Rationality is then what you will value the most and that which will serve as your guide.

Understand: The first step toward becoming rational is to understand our fundamental irrationality. There are two factors that should render this more palatable to our egos: nobody is exempt from the irresistible effect of emotions on the mind, not even the wisest among us; and to some extent irrationality is a function of the structure of our brains and is wired into our very nature by the way we process emotions. Being irrational is almost beyond our control. To understand this, we must look at the evolution of emotions themselves.

Clearly the words rational and irrational can be quite loaded. People are always labeling those who disagree with them “irrational.” What we need is a simple definition that can be applied as a way of judging, as accurately as possible, the difference between the two. The following shall serve as our barometer: We constantly feel emotions, and they continually infect our thinking, making us veer toward thoughts that please us and soothe our egos. It is impossible to not have our inclinations and feelings somehow involved in what we think. Rational people are aware of this and through introspection and effort are able, to some extent, to subtract emotions from their thinking and counteract their effect. Irrational people have no such awareness. They rush into action without carefully considering the ramifications and consequences.

Our thoughts almost inevitably revolve around this desire; we simply recoil from entertaining ideas that are unpleasant or painful to us. We imagine we are looking for the truth, or being realistic, when in fact we are holding on to ideas that bring a release from tension and soothe our egos, make us feel superior. This pleasure principle in thinking is the source of all of our mental biases. If you believe that you are somehow immune to any of the following biases, it is simply an example of the pleasure principle in action.

The global beliefs you have about the concepts of scarcity and abundance, for example, will determine your stress level and your generosity of time, money, energy, and spirit. If you believe we live in a world with scarce resources—where there’s only so much money, so much time, so much love—then you’ll constantly live in fear that you won’t have enough.

“Finally,” Debra said, “I began to link pain to the idea of being a wimp. I knew my belief about being wimpy was limiting me, so I decided that was not who I wanted to be anymore.” Not only that, but all this time her psyche had been wrestling with the incongruity between how her friends viewed her and how she perceived her own identity. So when she had another chance to go skydiving, she seized upon it as an opportunity to make the leap from potentiality to actuality, from “what could be” to “what is.” It was time to boost her “adventurous” identity from opinion to conviction.

Our task, as students of human nature, is threefold. First, we must fully understand the phenomenon of the deep narcissist. Although they are in the minority, some of them can inflict an unusual amount of harm in the world. We must be able to distinguish the toxic types that stir up drama and try to turn us into objects they can use for their purposes. They can draw us in with their unusual energy, but if we become enmeshed, it can be a nightmare to disengage. They are masters at turning the tables and making others feel guilty. Narcissistic leaders are the most dangerous of all, and we must resist their pull and see through the façade of their apparent creativity. Knowing how to handle the deep narcissists in our lives is an important art for all of us. Second, we must be honest about our own nature and not deny it. We are all narcissists. In a conversation we are all champing at the bit to talk, to tell our story, to give our opinion. We like people who share our ideas—they reflect back to us our good taste. If we happen to be assertive, we see assertiveness as a positive quality because it is ours, whereas others, more timid, will rate it as obnoxious and value introspective qualities. We are all prone to flattery because of our self-love. Moralizers who try to separate themselves and denounce the narcissists in the world today are often the biggest narcissists of them all—they love the sound of their voice as they point fingers and preach. We are all on the spectrum of self-absorption. Creating a self that we can love is a healthy development, and there should be no stigma attached to it. Without self-esteem from within, we would fall into deep narcissism. But to move beyond functional narcissism, which should be our goal, we must first be honest with ourselves. Trying to deny our self-absorbed nature, trying to pretend we are somehow more altruistic than others, makes it impossible for us to transform ourselves. Third and most important, we must begin to make the transformation into the healthy narcissist. Healthy narcissists have a stronger, even more resilient sense of self. They tend to hover closer to the top of the scale. They recover more quickly from any wounds or insults. They do not need as much validation from others. They realize at some point in life that they have limits and flaws. They can laugh at these flaws and not take slights so personally. In many ways, by embracing the full picture of themselves, their self-love is more real and complete. From this stronger inner position, they can turn their attention outward more often and more easily. This attention goes in one of two directions, and sometimes both. First, they are able to direct their focus and their love into their work, becoming great artists, creators, and inventors. Because their outward focus on the work is more intense, they tend to be successful in their ventures, which gives them the necessary attention and validation. They can have moments of doubt and insecurity, and artists can be notoriously brittle, but work stands as a continual release from too much self-absorption.

As an adjunct to this, mirroring people on any level will draw out an empathic response from them. This can be physical, and is known as the chameleon effect. People who are connecting physically and emotionally in a conversation will tend to mimic each other’s gestures and posture, both crossing their legs, for instance. To a degree, you can do this consciously to induce a connection by deliberately mimicking someone. Similarly, nodding your head as they talk and smiling will deepen the connection. Even better, you can enter the spirit of the other person. You absorb their mood deeply and reflect it back to them. You create a feeling of rapport. People secretly crave this emotional rapport in their daily lives, because they get it so rarely. It has a hypnotic effect and appeals to people’s narcissism as you become their mirror.

I am continually redefining myself, and people often wonder at my level of confidence in pursuing new ventures. I’m often asked, “How have you accomplished so much in your life?” I think that a big part of it is that I look at things in a different way than most: while most people have to establish competence before they feel confident, I decide to feel confident, and that provides the sense of certainty to persist until I am competent. That’s why my identity is not limited by my past references.

“You would become ‘dead’ silent. Your ears would perk up and you would listen intently in the direction the silence came from. You’d be searching for a cause and your awareness would reach out to the next available sound that stood out. Now what you have to do is learn how to create the same effect. When you’re playing to an inattentive audience, you and your bandmates are the background noise. Something must change before you can cause the audience to listen. They may decide on their own to start listening, or you can decide for them. You can make them listen without their even knowing it. The best way to do that is through dynamics, or even better, through space. Create silence and let the next sound that speaks to them be your bass. If done well, they’ll listen to you for the rest of the night. That’s all I did for my solo.”

As much as you can, you want to work and associate with strong characters and avoid weak ones. This has been the basis for almost all of Warren Buffett’s investment decisions.

Months later while playing with a band, I thought about my experience at the lake. I was able to use it to remind myself how to listen and fit in with other musicians. My new-found listening skill was one most other musicians neglected. It wasn’t that they couldn’t listen as well as I could; they just didn’t. I noticed that most musicians seemed to reserve their ears for themselves rather than open up their ears to the rest of the band. I found that when I listened to the other musicians more than I listened to myself, I played better. I realize that listening is a choice. The same is true in conversation. When I listen to other people more than to myself, I know how to respond and support them in a better way. It also helps me know when to remain quiet.

Finally, you need to also refine or cultivate those traits that go into a strong character—resilience under pressure, attention to detail, the ability to complete things, to work with a team, to be tolerant of people’s differences. The only way to do so is to work on your habits, which go into the slow formation of your character. For instance, you train yourself to not react in the moment by repeatedly placing yourself in stressful or adverse situations in order to get used to them. In boring everyday tasks, you cultivate greater patience and attention to detail. You deliberately take on tasks slightly above your level. In completing them, you have to work harder, helping you establish more discipline and better work habits. You train yourself to continually think of what is best for the team. You also search out others who display a strong character and associate with them as much as possible. In this way you can assimilate their energy and their habits. And to develop some flexibility in your character, always a sign of strength, you occasionally shake yourself up, trying out some new strategy or way of thinking, doing the opposite of what you would normally do.

But what happens when you think about someone else’s problems instead? The nature of the internal struggle changes, right? Sure, you might feel sad or upset when you think about their difficulties, but it feels very different from obsessing about your own problems. There’s a shift in perspective. And this is such an important part of training the mind. By focusing less on your own worries and more on the potential happiness of others you actually create more headspace for yourself. Not only that, but the mind becomes softer, more malleable, easier to work with. It tends to be quicker to settle on the object of meditation, less easily distracted by passing thoughts. It also tends to be clearer, more stable and less reactive to volatile emotions. So giving your practice an altruistic edge is about so much more than simply doing the right thing.

“When you experience pleasant sensations in your practice, I want you to imagine sharing those feelings with other people,” he began. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s the pleasant sensation of a quiet mind, of a relaxed body or a comforting emotion; simply imagine you are giving it away, sharing it with your friends and family, the people you care about.” He continued. “It doesn’t require lots of thought and I still want you to focus on the breath, just counting the breaths as they pass. But, if you find yourself sitting there and you feel very good, then maintain this attitude of wanting to share it with others.” I couldn’t really see how this was going to help, but it sounded harmless enough and the sentiment was well meaning. “This next bit might be a little more challenging,” he said, smiling broadly. “When you experience discomfort in your meditation, whether it’s the restlessness of a busy mind, physical tension in the body, or a challenging emotion, I want you to imagine it’s the discomfort of the people you care about.

When you came here I said that meditation would teach you to be more aware, I never said it would get rid of unpleasant emotions. It just so happens that when you’re more aware there is very little room for these unpleasant emotions to operate.

“why would you react very strongly when you can’t even find a feeling there to react to? In order to resist something you need to have an idea of what it is. Often our ‘idea’ of a feeling is just that, an idea. When we look a little more closely, we see that the idea is actually not what we thought it was. This makes it very difficult to resist. And with no resistance, there is simply acceptance of the emotion.”

We need to find a way to be aware of our emotions, to experience, acknowledge and live with them, and yet not be at their mercy. Mindfulness and meditation show us how best to do this.

qualities you bring to your own approach will always reflect your upbringing and your character. Some of these qualities you might like and find helpful, others may feel uncomfortable and decidedly unhelpful. But if you can bring a sense of genuine intrigue and curiosity to your meditation, then it doesn’t really matter what those qualities are. That’s because they become part of the meditation, part of that which is observed. One of my teachers always used to describe this quality as gentle curiosity. When this becomes part of your approach to meditation you’ll notice that the mind feels very open.

In order to get the very most from meditation, you’ll probably want to integrate it with your everyday life. And in order to do that, you’ll need to add the second component—clarity. This way you get to see what’s causing the tension in the first place, you get to understand how and why you feel the way you do in certain situations. It’s the difference between “responding skillfully” to situations and “reacting impulsively.”

The imaginary lovers When I was training as a novice monk, I stayed in several monasteries that were generally closed to the public, but that once in a while opened their doors so that lay-people could come and do a one-week meditation retreat. The men would stay in the monks’ quarters and the women would live with the nuns. Each day they’d come together for a number of meditation sessions. These retreats were always conducted in silence, to offer the participants as few distractions as possible. For some people this really helped, while for others it was torture to go a whole week without talking. Every afternoon the participants would visit the respective monks and nuns and report back on how their meditation was going. Over the years the monks and the nuns started to recognize a pattern of behavior that seemed to repeat itself. In the moments when the men and women would come together, eyes would inevitably wander, sometimes catching another pair of wandering eyes in the process. This would usually happen early on in the week. Little did the pair realize at the time the significance of this fleeting glance. The man would go back to his room and sit to meditate. Within seconds he’d be thinking about this woman, talking to himself in the process. “She definitely looked at me. I think I might be in there. And this is perfect, she’s interested in meditation, so we’d have loads in common. Right, as soon as we’re allowed to talk I’ll ask her out.” Already he’d be looking forward to the next meeting of eyes. Meanwhile, over in the nuns’ quarters, the woman would be thinking, “I wonder if he saw me? Did he like me? It would be so nice to be in a relationship with someone who’s sensitive enough to take care of his own mind.” Not even ten minutes has passed and yet already the “R” word has popped up in the internal conversation! This pattern would continue throughout the week, the pair stealing glances once in a while and then feeding off their projection of those glances the rest of the time. We’ve all done it, right? By the end of the week, it’s no exaggeration to say that some couples had taken that chain of thought so far, that not only had they dated in their minds, but they’d got married, consummated the marriage, had children, and spent time thinking where they might retire to. Some had even got divorced! Even though it was their own story that they were creating, they had still chosen to build in some pain and anguish. Yet they’d never even spoken to the other person. This shows how easy it is to get caught up in all the little stories, the dramas, the hopes and the fears of the mind.

The story also illustrates the danger of waiting for the meditation to finish. It’s a common experience and it’s almost as though we think that by simply sitting there and not moving, we’re meditating, no matter what we’re doing with the mind. But this underlying sense of expectation, of waiting for something to happen, is a mind that is looking to the future, as opposed to a mind resting in the present. Think about it, how can there ever be a sense of ease resting in the present moment if the mind is hurriedly trying to get to a space and time in the future?

While it’s best to learn meditation sitting upright in a chair, you may feel that you’d rather do it lying down. This may sound more appealing, but it’s a lot more difficult to get the right balance of focus and relaxation when you do it lying down and you may well find yourself drifting off into sleep. If you do choose this option, make sure you lie on a firm surface with the arms and legs out straight. You might also like to place a pillow under the knees to take the pressure off your lower back.

Be clear where you’re going next and what you’re about to do, as this will help to maintain that sense of awareness. Maybe it’s going to the kitchen to make a cup of tea, or perhaps it’s going back to the office to sit at your computer.

What you’ll notice when you start to apply this approach to situations is that it has a very soothing effect on the mind. Not only are you present to experience everything you do (quite literally living life to the fullest), but it also feels very calming. And with calm comes clarity. You begin to see how and why you think and feel the way you do. You start to notice the patterns and tendencies of the mind. And what this does is to give you back the choice of how you live your life. Rather than being swept away by undermining or unproductive thoughts and emotions, you can respond in the way you’d actually like to.

Why are so many people afraid to take such small steps to help others? One of the most common reasons is that they are just embarrassed to be doing something they’re uncertain about. They’re afraid of being rejected or appearing foolish. But you know what? If you want to play the game and win, you’ve got to play “full out.” You’ve got to be willing to feel stupid, and you’ve got to be willing to try things that might not work—and if they don’t work, be willing to change your approach. Otherwise, how could you innovate, how could you grow, how could you discover who you really are?

However, make balance your watchword. Strive for balance rather than perfection. Most people live in a black-and-white world where they think that they’re either a volunteer with no life of their own, or just a materialistic, achievement-oriented person who doesn’t care to make a difference. Don’t fall into this trap. Life is a balance between giving and receiving, between taking care of yourself and taking care of others. Yes, give some of your time, capital and energy to those who truly need it—but also be willing to give to yourself. And do so with joy, not with guilt. You don’t have to take the weight of the world on your shoulders. More people would contribute if they realized that they didn’t have to give anything up to do so. So do a little, and know that it can mean a lot. If everyone did this, fewer people would have to do so much, and more people would be helped!

What’s the message? Live life fully “while you’re here. Experience everything. Take care of yourself and your friends. Have fun, be crazy, be weird. Go out and screw up! You’re going to anyway, so you might as well enjoy the process! Take the opportunity to learn from your mistakes: find the cause of your problem and eliminate it. Don’t try to be perfect; just be an excellent example of being human. Constantly find ways to improve yourself. Practice the discipline of CANI!; be a lifelong learner. Take the time now to set up your Master System so that the game of life is winnable. Let your humanity—your caring for yourself and others—be the guiding principle of your life, but don’t treat life so seriously that you lose the power of spontaneity, the pleasure that comes from being silly and being a kid.

Down [1] Hold a food reward in front of the cat’s face. At the same time, say its name and give the command, “down.” [2] Slowly lower the treat to the cat’s chest. Ideally, the cat will lower its body as it follows. [3] Slowly move the treat away from the cat’s face, so that it stretches out to follow it and naturally adopts the “down” position. [4] When the cat lies down, offer praise and the treat. [5] Repeat, during daily training sessions, until the feline masters the behavior.

Coming When Called This behavior can be particularly helpful if your cat ever escapes outdoors. [1] Pick a spot in the house, sit down, and call to the cat in a pleasant voice. Attract it by any means necessary, including treats. [2] When the cat comes, offer praise and a reward. [3] Move to a different location and repeat the exercise. [4] Repeat over as many days as necessary until the cat reliably comes when called.  CAUTION: Never call the cat to an unpleasant experience (such as bathing). Instead, go to the cat. Associating unpleasantness with the “come” command will cause the feline to delete the entire subroutine.

Sit [1] Hold a food reward over the cat’s head (Fig. A). At the same time, say its name and give the command to “sit.” [2] Move the treat backward over its head until the cat naturally lowers into the sitting position (Fig. B). If it doesn’t, lightly press the cat’s hindquarters down. Keep the treat above its head and say “sit.” [3] When the cat sits, offer praise and the treat. [4] Repeat, during daily training sessions, until the feline masters the behavior.

Fetch Strangely, some cats enjoy this most doglike of games. However, participation is a highly personal choice (for the feline). The only way to know if your cat carries the necessary programming is to try to initiate it. [1] Toss a small cotton toy in your cat’s presence—preferably something the feline particularly enjoys. [2] Wait until the cat goes to the toy and takes it in its mouth. [3] Call the cat to you. [4] If the cat returns with the toy, offer to trade it for a treat. Praise your cat if it drops the toy in exchange for the treat. [5] Repeat as many times as necessary until the cat understands what is expected.

is also vital to examine the wording on the front of the label. If a product advertises itself as “chicken cat food,” then at least 95 percent of the product must be composed of the named item (or 70 percent, if moisture content is included). If the product contains more than 25 percent but less than 95 percent of its signature item, then it must be called “chicken formula,” “chicken platter,” or use some other qualifier. And foods incorporating the word “with” (as in “cat food with chicken”) may include as little as 3 percent of the named ingredient.

The best approach is to select a standard time to offer a meal (it should not vary from day to day), then present the food. In most cases there will be no question of leftovers; once the cat understands the system, it will polish off each portion rapidly. Two meals a day, one in the morning and one in the evening (to correspond to the feline’s traditional hunting times), are sufficient for an adult cat.

EXPERT TIP: Felines are programmed to conceal pain and discomfort, so getting an accurate reading on their health can often be difficult. For this reason it is important to carefully observe your cat’s normal behavior—everything from how it walks to how it interacts with you. This can serve as a baseline with which to compare suspicious changes.

In an 'at will' employment arrangement between a corporation and an employee, either party can terminate the contract at any time. However, instead of a few weeks of severance, imagine what would happen if the employer was legally required to pay the employee half of his or her paycheck for 20 additional years, irrespective of anything the employee did or did not do, under penalty of imprisonment for the CEO.

So, to review, the differences between Marriage 1.0 and Marriage 2.0 are : a) No fault asset division and alimony, where the abandoned spouse has to pay if he earns more, even if he did not want a divorce, and even if he is a victim of abuse, cuckolding, or adultery. There are rare instances of high-earning women getting caught in this trap as well. b) Women marrying after having 5 or more sexual partners, compared to just 0-1 previously. This makes it harder for the woman to form a pair bond with her husband. c) Women marrying at an age when very few years of their peak beauty are remaining, compared to a decade or more remaining under Marriage 1.0. d) Child custody is almost never granted to the man, so he loses his children on a 'no fault' basis.

Seizures: Could signal any number of malfunctions, from poisoning to a severe head injury. Remain with the cat during the episode and, if possible, time how long it lasts. Once it passes, consult your veterinarian. If the seizure continues for longer than 5 minutes, transport the cat (if necessary, while still seizing) to the veterinary office. To avoid injury, wear protective clothing (long sleeves, gloves) while handling the feline. Also, try to remember what transpired just before the attack; knowledge of these events may be helpful in determining a cause.

A woman says she wants to meet a nice guy and get married—yet she spends all her time around jerks. A man says that he wishes he could find a great job, but he hasn’t actually bothered to do the looking. Business executives try to pursue two different strategies at the same time—straddling it’s called—and they are shocked when they succeed at neither. All of these people, just as is often true for us too, are deceived and divided. One hand is working against the other. As Martin Luther King Jr. once put it, “There is something of a civil war going on within all of our lives,” a war inside each individual between the good parts of their soul and the bad. The Stoics say that that war is usually a result of our conflicting desires, our screwed-up judgments or biased thoughts. We don’t stop and ask: OK, what do I really want? What am I actually after here? If we did, we’d notice the contradictory and inconsistent wishes that we have. And then we’d stop working against ourselves.

As the relationship continues to evolve, both partners finally get to know each other. Routine sets in. If we want novelty, we must create it—a weekend in the country, new furniture, new fantasies.

Naïve, idealistic hopes had been shattered. Scholars found that, contrary to the happy wishes of most people, it was not a good idea for the human race as a whole to make contact with extraterrestrials. The impact of such contact on human society would be divisive rather than uniting, and would exacerbate rather than mitigate the conflicts between different cultures. In summary, if contact were to occur, the internal divisions within Earth civilization would be magnified and likely lead to disaster. The most shocking conclusion of all was that the impact would have nothing at all to do with the degree and type of contact (unidirectional or bidirectional), or the form and degree of advancement of the alien civilization.

The reason why the sun’s motion seems patternless is because our world has three suns. Under the influence of their mutually perturbing gravitational attraction, their movements are unpredictable—the three-body problem. When our planet revolves around one of the suns in a stable orbit, that’s a Stable Era. When one or more of the other suns move within a certain distance, their gravitational pull will snatch the planet away from the sun it’s orbiting, causing it to wander unstably through the gravitational fields of the three suns. That’s a Chaotic Era. After an uncertain amount of time, our planet is once again pulled into a temporary orbit and another Stable Era begins. This is a football game at the scale of the universe. The players are the three suns, and our planet is the football.”

“Even so, at least they prevented the Aztecs from developing without bound, turning the Americas into a bloody, dark great empire. Then civilization as we know it wouldn’t have appeared in the Americas, and democracy wouldn’t have thrived until much later. Indeed, maybe they wouldn’t have appeared at all. This is the key to the question: No matter what the Trisolarans are like, their arrival will be good news for the terminally ill human race.”

We are all refugees from our childhoods. And so we turn, among other things, to stories. To write a story, to read a story, is to be a refugee from the state of refugees. Writers and readers seek a solution to the problem that time passes, that those who have gone are gone and those who will go, which is to say every one of us, will go. For there was a moment when anything was possible. And there will be a moment when nothing is possible. But in between we can create.

“But my moment feels just as real to me as yours does to you. Are they both real? Is it only our consciousness that makes it so? I can imagine you sitting there in four years, even though you’re right beside me in this moment, in my moment, and I feel like I can reach through the camera and touch you. I wish I could. I’ve experienced over two hundred years, and at the end of it all, I think Slade was right. It’s just a product of our evolution the way we experience reality and time from moment to moment. How we differentiate between past, present, and future. But we’re intelligent enough to be aware of the illusion, even as we live by it, and so, in moments like this—when I can imagine you sitting exactly where I am, listening to me, loving me, missing me—it tortures us. Because I’m locked in my moment, and you’re locked in yours.”

Space is one of the few places where time makes sense to him. He knows, on an intellectual level, that when he looks at any object, he’s looking back in time. In the case of his own hand, it takes the light a nanosecond—one billionth of a second—to transport the image to his eyes. When he looks at the research station from half a mile away, he’s seeing the structure as it existed 2,640 nanoseconds ago.

Always aim to get an emotional reaction - such as the possibility of danger, being somewhat kind, challenging her, giving her doubt about you liking her, showing interest, or not showing interest.  When you use a combination of these, it will leave her always wondering about you and where she stands.  This by itself gets you on her mind.

Not knowing where you belong creates status anxiety, which women don’t respond to very well.  So being comfortable with who you are and not seeking approval or trying to fit in, will give you higher status.  Let others conform to you.  You are the leader of your life.   Have this mindset when talking and texting a woman.  Talk like you’re just friends and you don’t need her to be happy.  You are the source of your own happiness.

Text messaging is where qualifying and the “game” come into play.  Women are great at sending mixed messages, and they respond well when men do it to them.  Sending mixed messages will get a woman wondering if you are serious or joking - like texting, “You’re fun!

Try no to laugh in a text.  That is for women to do.  Rarely will I even say “Ha” in a text because it destroys the tension.  A smiley face can be fun at times :) When I text a girl, I often use dry humor to create more suspense and mystery. Now I love to laugh and I do it often, but when it comes to texting I find the James Bond method to be the most effective… the slight grin on your face while keeping your composure.  Watch the face of Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, especially the part when he says to the one married woman, “Perhaps you’re just out of practice.” (He’s implying that she can still be a player).  If you watch that scene you will notice that he doesn’t break his composure and has that sly smile that tells her that he is playing with her.  He doesn’t laugh or get uncomfortable and he confidently lets her laugh off the tension.  That’s what I mean by the James Bond approach.

Most importantly, keep it fun and flirty to where the woman doesn’t really have to reply but you know she will be compelled to you because your text is emotionally charged. Something Like “Wow, I thought I was shallow.” or “I haven’t lost all respect for you… yet.” Or “I’m just better looking than you… but I still think you’re cute.”  This playful texting is what women love to read.

The key is to get her to laugh at herself.  It’s great to expose a woman’s insecurities and have her laugh about them. I’ve even said to girls that they are boring and that they had to prove to me that they know how to be fun.  Women love attention and a challenge at the same time.  So regulate that attention by either not giving them any or just playfully teasing them so they can almost feel like you’re possibly pursuing them.  If you do it right, you will always be happy you teased her.

  “You know what else is interesting…” “Oh, by the way…” “I just remembered that…” “I just noticed how cute you are” “You know before I forget…” “I never realized how special you really are” “That reminds me…” “I’m noticing…” “I’m finding…”

Object writing is about showing, not telling. It is an exercise, like a morning workout, that you use to stay in shape. And it happens to be really fun and challenging. It's not only worth the effort, it's a pleasure to do. You should stay with it, religiously, for at least six weeks. The record so far is Polk Shelton of Austin, Texas, who did his object writing every morning for five years straight. His writing skyrocketed. Ten minutes every day for at least six weeks. You won't believe what happens.

For investors who live in a city with a local tax, owning municipal bonds issued by their local government can be triple tax-free, since they’d pay no federal, state, or local taxes on the income from those bonds. Because of these tax advantages, municipal bonds, which normally yield less than comparable taxable bonds, can make sense for investors in the higher tax brackets (usually 25 percent and above). However, you’d need to check the tax-free bond’s yield against other available taxable bond choices to see which would give you the greatest after-tax return.

This stupid belief is rooted in the “Something about Mary” myth that women don’t want an overly sexualized man, but the biological truth is far from that. The myth is one that women need to be comfortable with a guy in order to sleep with him, so men will actively de-sexualize themselves in order to comply. However, all indications point to a need for sexual anxiety and tension in arousal to prompt sexual intercourse.

We became aware of our mortality quite early on in childhood, and this filled us with an anxiety that we cannot remember but that was very real and visceral. Such anxiety cannot be wished away or denied. It sits in us as adults in a powerfully latent form. When we choose to repress the thought of death, our anxiety is only made stronger by our not confronting the source of it. The slightest incident or uncertainty about the future will tend to stir up this anxiety and even make it chronic. To fight this, we will tend to narrow down the scope of our thoughts and activities; if we don’t leave our comfort zones in what we think and do, then we can make life rather predictable and feel less vulnerable to anxiety.

There are plenty of examples of what seems to be the opposite—humans slaughtering thousands of fellow humans, often in war, with the sight of such mass deaths not stimulating the slightest sense of empathy. But in these cases, the slaughterers feel separate from those they are killing, whom they have come to see as less than human and under their power. With the plague, no one is spared, no matter their wealth or station in life. Everyone is equally at risk. Feeling personally vulnerable and seeing the vulnerability of everyone else, people’s normal sense of difference and privilege is melted away, and an uncommon generalized empathy emerges. This could be a natural state of mind, if we could only envision the vulnerability and mortality of others as not separate from our own.

The best place to start a business is where people need help. Finding demand for products and services is a smarter investment of your time than researching suppliers of products that nobody may want. This may sound obvious but I’ve seen far too many entrepreneurs miss it. They focus so narrowly on promoting ideas or products related to their own passions that they skip right over this fundamental requirement. If you serve a need outside of your own need to make money by helping people solve problems, make more money, lose weight, feel better, or enjoy their lives more, you are far more likely to find recurring, profitable customers.

And it made him anxious. He deeply admired his father—he was a man of very high principle. But Martin Jr. could not avoid sensing the growing differences between them in taste and temperament. The son was more easygoing. He loved attending parties, wearing nice clothes, dating girls, and dancing. As he got older, he developed a pronounced serious and introspective side and was drawn to books and learning. It was almost as if there were two people inside of him—one social, the other solitary and reflective. His father, on the other hand, was not complicated at all.

The pursuit of pleasure: For many of us, work is just an irritating necessity of life. What really motivates us is avoiding pain, and finding as much pleasure as possible in our time outside work. The pleasures we pursue can take various forms—sex, stimulants, entertainment, eating, shopping, gambling, technological fads, games of all sorts. No matter the objects of the pursuit, they tend to lead to a dynamic of diminishing returns. The moments of pleasure we get tend to get duller through repetition. We need either more and more of the same or constantly new diversions. Our need often turns into an addiction, and with the dependency comes a diminishing of health and mental powers. We become possessed by the objects we crave and lose ourselves. Under the influence of drugs or alcohol, for instance, we can temporarily feel transported beyond the banality of our lives. This form of false purpose is very common in the world today, largely because of the cornucopia of distractions we can choose from.

All of us require pleasurable moments outside work, ways to relieve our tension. But when we operate with a sense of purpose, we know the value of limiting ourselves, opting for depth of experience rather than overstimulation.

We all know the effects of “hyperintention”: If we want and need desperately to sleep, we are less likely to fall asleep. If we absolutely must give the best talk possible at some conference, we become hyperanxious about the result, and the performance suffers. If we desperately need to find an intimate partner or make friends, we are more likely to push them away. If instead we relax and focus on other things, we are more likely to fall asleep or give a great talk or charm people. The most pleasurable things in life occur as a result of something not directly intended and expected. When we try to manufacture happy moments, they tend to disappoint us.

The same goes for the dogged pursuit of money and success. Many of the most successful, famous, and wealthy individuals do not begin with an obsession with money and status. One prime example would be Steve Jobs, who amassed quite a fortune in his relatively short life. He actually cared very little for material possessions. His singular focus was on creating the best and most original designs, and when he did so, good fortune followed him. Concentrate on maintaining a high sense of purpose, and the success will flow to you naturally.

The enraged assassins had had enough. The next day they returned to the castle with her six children and called Caterina to the ramparts. With daggers and spears pointed at them in the most menacing fashion, and with the children wailing and begging for mercy, they ordered Caterina to surrender the fortress or they would kill them all. Surely they had already proven they were more than willing to shed blood. She might be fearless and the daughter of a Sforza, but no mother could possibly watch her children die before her eyes. Caterina wasted no time. She shouted down: “Do it then, you fools! I am already pregnant with another child by Count Riario and I have the means to make more!” at which she lifted her skirts, as if to emphasize her meaning.

distant prisons. Whenever crowds of people bet their life savings on a hopeless proposition, it’s called a “mania” or a “bubble.” The pattern is always the same. Frantic investors pay ridiculous prices in order to get in on a spurious opportunity, and sooner or later, the prices come crashing down. After the Mississippi “bubble” burst, and people realized Law’s company was a sham and Law himself was nothing more than a financial Wizard of Oz, investors tried to unload their shares and found no buyers. They lost their life savings, the French economy collapsed, and the banking system collapsed along with it. As quickly as Law had become a French hero, he became a French goat.

During the great era of the cowboy, which lasted only about twenty-five years, a slew of cattle-ranching stocks appeared on the stock exchanges. In the late 1860s, there were 38 million cows and 39 million people in the United States, or roughly one cow for every inhabitant. Cowboys made a big impression on the easterners who bought into this bull market.

People felt great pride when they worked hard and made certain sacrifices in order to pay for something all at once. It made them nervous to owe money to the banks, and when they paid off their home mortgages, they had parties and invited all the neighbors to help them celebrate. It wasn’t until the 1960s that Americans got into the habit of using credit cards, and it wasn’t until the 1980s that average families were hocked to the limit on mortgages, car loans, home equity loans, and the unpaid balances on their cards.

Contrary to popular belief I’m not an advocate of the Dark Triad methodologies of Game. Not because I think they’re ineffective, but rather because, with the right art of Game they’re not even needed. Only in extreme cases are the dark arts to be employed, and if a situation necessitates their use it’s important for a guy to understand that a line has been crossed with a woman who necessitated their use.

What most guys think are ‘mixed messages’ or confusing behavior coming from a woman is simply due to their inability (for whatever reason) to make an accurate interpretation of why she’s behaving in such a manner. Usually this boils down to a guy getting so wrapped up in a single, solitary girl that he’d rather make concessions for her behavior than see it for what it really is. In other words, it’s far easier to call it ‘mixed messages’ or fall back on the old chestnut of how fickle and random women are, when in fact it’s simply a rationale to keep themselves on the hook, so to speak, because they lack any real, viable, options with other women in their lives.

That’s what the lines of communication being broken means. When she checks out of the relationship, she doesn’t tell you because she’s checked out of the relationship.

As funny as all this was, it serves to show that women live and operate in gender assumptions that they simply take as normalized conditions.

It’s the man who remains in touch with his masculine side, the guy who, despite all of pop-culture denigrating and ridiculing his gender and the very aspects that make it a necessary, positive strength of human society, will endure and steadfastly resist the influences that want to turn it into something it was never intended; it’s this guy and his confidence that women all over the world find irresistible. He embodies the masculine arousal that their feminine has been seeking and they can’t explain it. This is the ultimate meta-shit test in sexual selection – to discover or learn what it is to be positively masculine and remain so in a world that constantly berates his gender, that tells him he’s poisoned by his testosterone while confirming the same masculine attributes as a positive for women. It’s the guy who understands that it’s gender differences, not androgynous similarities, that make us strong. It’s the Man who can see that the sexes were meant to be complimentary, not adversarial, who passes this shit test. Gender redefinition, as a social convention, serves as an Alpha filtering mechanism.

While at university, my field of specialization in behavioral psychology was personality studies, and I can tell you there are a lot of theories and interpretations of what constitutes identity. However, one article that is agreed upon almost universally is that identity and personality are never static and are mailable and changeable due to influencing variables and conditions. A very pronounced illustration of this would be soldiers retuning from combat with post traumatic stress disorder – a very identifiable and verifiable form of psychosis. These men are changed individuals and their identities are altered from the time they were subject to the psychological rigors of warfare to returning back to a normalized life. Some have the resilience to adjust their personalities back to a somewhat normalized state, others sadly do not. Yet in each case the change was influenced by conditions and environment.

Remember this, PUA skills are tools, and valuable ones, but adopting a positive masculine mindset prepares you for more. An AFC needs to divorce himself from deep set social and psychological schema – he needs to unlearn the self-delusions that a lifetime has conditioned him to internalize into his personality. Giving an AFC Game skills before this transition will only condemn him to disappointment and despair in an LTR. The more important lesson is learned in the discarding of that old, Beta, way of thinking, while understanding the tools and techniques to apply your new, confident, positive masculine mindset.

Your “education” doesn’t stop once you’ve unplugged. In fact I’d argue that it’s even more vital in internalizing a new mindset since you’re now putting things into practice. One thing I remind guys who spit the red pill back up is that there is no going back. A lot of frustrated guys who discover Game and fail to apply it because they lack the social skills or they convinced themselves that PUArtistry was their easy magic formula to fuck the girl of their dreams, they tend to want to regress back into the comfortable shell of their former ignorance of intergender social dynamics. Only they find that there is no return. They see the truth in the what they’d been blind to no matter where they turn. The social interactions, the feminization, the raw deal they’ve been conditioned to accept as normal – all of that subtly reminds them of the truth they’re avoiding and they hate it. They become hostile to it.

I can’t begin to recall all of the times I’ve counseled young guys, giving them all manner of advice and encouraging them to put it into practice, only to have them constantly bemoan that they can’t find the motivation. More often than not it takes some traumatic experience or they have to be reduced to having nothing left to lose before they’ll really have the fire lit under their asses to become more than they are. I don’t consider myself a motivational speaker, but at some point you have to cross the abyss and change your mind about yourself. You must kill the Beta you, to become something more.

The “Relationships are work” meme is a feminine Social Convention. How often do you hear men say these words? This convention has filtered into popular consciousness even amongst men now. For the LTR men who subscribe to this I’d also speculate that many of them are in relationships where they are “doing the work” for the women who are giving them the ‘grade’ so to speak. And of the single men who subscribe to this mythology, each had to be conditioned to believe this is the case in LTRs by women. This is rooted in the mistaken belief that men’s actions and sacrifices can ever be appreciated by women.

One thing we all struggle to protect is a positive self-image. The more important the aspect of your self-image that’s challenged by the truth, the more likely you are to go into denial. If you have a strong sense of self-worth and competence, your self-image can take hits but remain largely intact; if you’re beset by self-doubt (a hallmark of self-righteous AFC thinking), however, any acknowledgment of failure can be devastating and any admission of error painful to the point of being unthinkable.

Attribute it to an outside element (women won’t play by “the rules”) rather than resort to introspection (maybe I’m wrong about “the rules”?). Therefore we see AFCs tenaciously cling to a moralistic sense of purpose in their methods which is only reinforced by popular culture in our media, our music, eHarmony, our religion, etc.

Also keep in mind that modern social pressures (social media etc.) exacerbate this, and further distort women’s realistic evaluations of their own sexual market value (SMV) at any given phase of her life. The most secure, monogamous attachments women will make are with Men they perceive to be 1 to 2 points above what she perceives is her own relative SMV.

Hypergamy is far easier to contain the less a woman is able to capitalize on it. Imposing limitations on women’s Hypergamy is really a matter of application. Why is our reflexive response to label possessive men as ‘insecure’? Because beneath an overt exercising of control we believe a man lacks the capacity to inspire genuine desire in a woman which prompts her to self-regulate her own Hypergamy. Yet, we still consider Mate Guarding behaviors (both conscious and subconscious) to be wise in a measured application. So there you have the line in controlling Hypergamy – like virtually anything else in Game, apply it overtly and you appear ‘insecure’, apply it covertly and you appear confident and in control.

If a woman’s predominant perception of you is Alpha, if her mental point of origin is one in which she recognizes her own SMV as being subordinate to your own, she wont be asking your “permission” to go to Las Vegas with her girlfriends for a weekend because her desire for a man she perceives as Alpha (hopefully you) will be stronger than her peers’ influence on her during her ovulation week.

In theory, no woman who sees you as her perceived Alpha and Hypergamous best interest will want to ‘cheat’ on you – so the idea doesn’t occur to her. I realize this sounds simplistic until you consider the readiness with which most men will similarly isolate themselves socially, putting off friends and family in preference to spending his time with what he believes is a high-value woman.

There’s a manosphere idiom that states the only women who complain about men needing to Man Up or how men have somehow juvenilely shirked the masculine responsibilities society expects of them are always 30 years of age or older. Younger women simply have no incentive to complain about what they believe they are entitled to in a man beyond his being ‘hawt’.

Younger women simply have no incentive to complain about what they believe they are entitled to in a man beyond his being ‘hawt’. What I term as the Transition phase is the culmination of the Epiphany phase’s influence on a woman who has thus far been unable to consolidate on monogamy-my with a male who fulfills the role of provider (Beta provider most often) that her Hypergamy now holds in a much higher priority order. When women in this phase complain of men’s “adequacy issues” what they’re really bemoaning is their chronic inability to find (or merit) a man who can optimally balance the dual influences of her Hypergamy – Alpha Fucks and Beta Bucks.

Ultimatums are declarations of powerlessness because you are resorting to a direct threat to get someone to do what you want them to, and in doing so you overtly confess your weak position. If a woman were in a genuine position of control it wouldn’t be necessary to resort to an ultimatum; she’d simply use that control (as she likely did in her Party Years). There are many ways to effect a change in another person, but ultimatums will never prompt a genuine change. If they change behavior it’s prompted by the threat, not unprompted, organic desire.

“The truth is, I wanted to weep. I wanted to weep not just because I’m getting the leftovers. But also because her female mind will make sure she never understands. And also because I’m going to have to leave this girl soon if she expects me to invest more into her than I deem her worthy. And I wanted to weep because I honestly feel like she might be lost without me due to her mental illnesses and lack of self-control. And I wanted to weep because I know she will fuck men left and right after we break up. I wanted to weep because I fell in love with her no matter how many times I told myself not to. What kind of fucked up game is this?”

Here’s a curious paradox: the more you insist on sticking to a straight-and-narrow path defined by your own evolving principles, rather than the expedient one defined by current situation, the more you’ll have to twist and turn in the real world. The straight path in your head turns into spaghetti in the real world.  On the other hand, the more your path through the real world seems like a straight road, defined by something like a “standard” career script, the more you’ll have to twist and turn philosophically to justify your life to yourself. Every step that a true Golden Boy careerist takes, is marred by deep philosophical compromises. You sell your soul one career move at a time.

To actually keep moving forward, you’ll find that you need to twist and turn. Your terrain is the tortuous maze of truth-avoidance paths worn out by the “be somebody” types, and paved by the medal-awarding priests. Your mission is to tackle head-on, the truths that they work hard to avoid. Your own twists and turns are about avoiding or outmaneuvering those who want to deny truths and defend obvious falsehoods.  At some level, the be-somebody types dimly realize that their apparently straight career paths are actually the philosophically convoluted truth-avoiding ones. That’s why the moves made by slightly evil types seem like “shortcuts” to them. They don’t get how somebody can get someplace meaningful faster, without being on what seems to them to be the straight-line path, and without awards to measure progress.  Because ultimately the straight and narrow path defined by your own principles, grounded in truth-seeking, despite its apparent twists and turns in the real world, is the faster road to meaningful destinations.

This is because pessimism and optimism aren’t really attitudes about real things, which makes “realism” moot. Good and evil are about intentions, so realism is mostly irrelevant there as well. Optimism and pessimism are attitudes about possibilities when there is no empirical basis for assuming anything. It is possibly to be realistic about facts in all four quadrants, but be optimistic or pessimistic about possibilities and good or evil in terms of intentions.

bureaucrat. Time lags are strange things.  Personally, I resolve this particular dichotomy by thinking of realism as a desire to see the world realistically, and pragmatism as a desire to be effective. Believing you have achieved either desire is probably a sign that you’re actually trapped within one of the quadrants. It is skepticism and doubt that mark sophisticated realism and pragmatism, and distinguish them from quadrant-locked attitudes and behaviors.

“a company that starts down the road to evil in even a small way will end up totally evil.” His point reminded me of one often made in Agatha Christie novels by Hercule Poirot: that a murderer who has killed once finds it increasingly easy to kill again and again. In one novel, Death on the Nile, Poirot gravely tells a character, do not open your heart to evil.

An easy cost is a cost that is easy to pay. Money is the perfect example. It is the easiest way to pay for things, and also the easiest thing to give up, beyond a certain point. As many people like to say, money is a problem to be solved, not an end in itself. Once you’ve got yourself “problem solved” levels of money (corresponding to the lifestyle you want), giving up more money is far easier than (say) giving up a potentially rewarding lifelong relationship that you are tempted to exploit for immediate gain, simply because you can.

The self represents the parts of yourself that you accept, and are attached to. You see those parts primarily as strengths. The shadow represents the parts of yourself that you reject as weaknesses, and have developed an aversion to. It is, for the most part, subconscious or unconscious. You can generally only see your shadow by projecting it onto external realities. Especially other people. These people are, at a first approximation, the ones who feel like your evil twins: what is in your shadow is in their conscious self, and vice-versa. Your shadow persona manifests itself in your own behavior only under conditions of either extreme stress, or extreme relaxation.

The shadow reading of stories like Lee’s is very simple: sudden and dramatic career switches are often a case of moving from self-work to shadow-work or vice-versa. You either get so stressed out by working with your shadow personality (recall that it takes stress or relaxation to bring out shadow traits, and usually it is stress) that you flee towards self-expression. Or you find that purely indulging your self has costs that require you to muster up courage and tackle your shadow. That’s why the phrases self-expression and going over to the dark side are so often used to describe such career transitions.

Thomas Hobbes made a fundamentally pessimistic assumption: that humans in this state of nature are fundamentally competitive, violent and corruptible (tending to become more evil or wicked if left to themselves). For Hobbes, evil is natural, good is an aberration. Hobbes’ is a tragic view of the human condition.

Conversely, if status doesn’t matter to you, it becomes available to you as a situational control variable when dealing with those to whom status does matter. We all start out in a locked-status mode, but if you start breaking locked felt-played patterns then a curious thing happens: felt status of any sort weakens. Turns out felt status needs the nourishment of being hooked to a projected (and perceived-as-hoped and validated) status in order to survive. If you spend enough years breaking patterns in unpredictable ways, felt status starts to vanish altogether, leaving a sort of “status vacuum” inside you. The designated part of firmware dedicated to status seems to decay. The variable can nearly completely vanish. I suspect this happens to really good actors, like William H. Macy, who play a large status spectrum convincingly. This is one reason I don’t consider Denzel Washington a good actor: he never seems to play convincing low-status roles.

The best way to break patterns in random ways is simply to play situations in ways that suit your situational objectives. Your objectives and the related optimal patterns, will generally be in a random relationship to any locked patterns.  Now, on to the opening question: what status should you play in a given situation? Depends on what you want out of the situation, doesn’t it? What do you want the other person to do?

Being a status-player is also not an easy thing to hide in the long term, so you will be known for what you are, by people you interact with a lot. The best way to manage this perception is to openly acknowledge it and make sure your underlying values are understood and accepted by others. If you don’t make that clear, you’ll end up being viewed as an opportunistic, two-faced politician, and that perception is highly dangerous. Project your values clearly, and you’ll come across as “worldly wise,” a much safer perception.

You can dress differently on occasion, and adopt various sorts of convincing mannerisms and body language to project certain personalities. But it is really hard to talk convincingly about books, television shows and ideas you know little about. If somebody watches a lot E! and TMZ, but pretends in a job interview that they watch a lot of History Channel and read biographies, it is easy enough to ask them to talk about shows/books they’ve recently watched/read. Even if you haven’t watched/read them, you’ll be able to tell whether they are faking very easily.  Most people are far too cautious about making such judgments out of a sense of political correctness. Don’t be. The more you use this tactic, the better you’ll get at it. So don’t feel guilty about doing this. Go ahead and use the tactic and boldly jump to conclusions. Be prepared to self-correct if necessary.

This is a fantastically valuable skill to learn. And a very difficult one. It goes well beyond thick skin. It is hardened-cop-style “anything you say can and will be used against you” listening. To get there takes a very special kind of personal growth:  Get beyond thick skin: the only way to get to total impassivity in the face of strident criticism and insults is practice. And I am afraid this means developing a certain capacity for contempt. Williamson is clearly contemptuous of Levene’s opinion here.  Beyond-thick-skinned, contemptuous listening means you don’t take what is said about your personality as serious feedback worth responding to. But this does not mean you don’t listen. You listen in a sort of objective, clinical way, like a researcher observing an angry animal in a cage. Your radar is primed for information that is useful to you, not information that the other party thinks you ought to know (and is maliciously delighted to be able to give you).

You can sustain elaborate fantasies for a single person. For a large group, you can usually only sustain a few key beliefs. At the level of human civilization, you can only sustain extremely simple, but very fertile fill-in-the-blanks delusions, such as “the Universe is here to do your bidding” (it’s called The Secret, and the one thing the authors of that movement get right is that it is an age-old and very widespread delusion).

To be a professional organizer of delusions, you need to focus on delusions that it would actually benefit you to believe, at least temporarily, and then figure out how to adopt them for just as long as they can serve you.  Your overall goal is to create plausible deniability, even within your own mind, to defend against the accusation that you don’t believe something that you are pitching to others. Your lifeline back to reality is your capacity for doubt, which prevents plausible deniability from turning into a pattern of denial that persists long after the expiry date on the delusion.  It is much easier to do this if you discipline yourself to only work with delusions that are a sufficiently complex mix of metaphysics, morality arguments, metaphor, narrative and facts.  This is why you get the most fundamental axiom in delusion organization theory: the bigger the lie, the easier it is to sell, and the biggest ones, bigger than even the civilization-scale ones, are the ones you deliberately sell to yourself.

Adults are more likely to mix a conflict/harmony intention with a status intention. So you get the following four basic types of attitude informing an interaction:  Condescension: I am better than you and for you  Contempt: I am better than you and against you  Supplication: I am worse than you and for you  Insolence: I am worse than you and against you

Mixing and matching status movements with conflict/harmony elements is one of the most fun ways to both read and imagine little conversation scripts. For the student of Slightly Evil philosophy though, such status-and-conflict games are generally time-wasters (though you should learn to play them because you can be forced into them by external factors). Wherever possible, you should attempt to move the conversation to an open one that is about generating or exchanging information, or disengage if that turns out to be impossible.

An interpersonal interaction is open if both parties are seeking to trade or discover information. It is closed if even one party is seeking status validation, conflict or harmony instead.

People make this mistake for a simple reason: in routine negotiations, almost all the work is done away from the actual negotiating table, and before the critical face-to-face encounters. In many cases, the pre-work is so effective that the negotiation doesn’t happen at all, or if it happens, is a matter of ritual. The kind of tense, openly-adversarial zero-sum negotiation with a ticking clock that we see in movies is a very exceptional kind of negotiation. The kind of dull pre-work that is possible in routine negotiations is not possible, and there are artificially hard near-term deadlines. This puts a lot of tension and pressure into the live situation. The most common negotiations on the other hand, are the ones that don’t happen at all because a skilled person prevented things from getting to the table at all. Dull pre-work is substituted for live negotiation work, and instead of a fixed deadline, you get a smart person cherry-picking an ideal time to start the negotiations.

When you take a job take a long look at the people you’re going to be working with—because the odds are you’re going to become like them; they are not going to become like you. You can’t change them. If it doesn’t fit who you are, it’s not going to work. As we’ve established, bad work environments can make you a bad person and can make you unhappy. Cheating is infectious, as shown by Dan Ariely’s study “Contagion and Differentiation in Unethical Behavior: The Effect of One Bad Apple on the Barrel.” When you see your peers cheat, you’re more likely to cheat. And when your peers see each other cheat, everyone is more likely to bend the rules. That’s one step closer to Moldova. Luckily, the influence of context works both ways. The Terman Study, which followed over a thousand people from youth to death, came to the conclusion that the people who surround us often determine who we become. When we see others around us perform altruistic acts, we’re more likely to act altruistically ourselves. This also allows us to more safely be Givers—and get the success benefits that top-ranked Givers get without the fear of ending up a martyr. Connecting with other Givers was what allowed for the incredible success of the “nice” programs in Axelrod’s tournament. If you’re already in a bad environment, circle the wagons with other good people. It only took 5 percent of interactions between “nice” programs for good to get the edge over bad. That may not translate perfectly to the everyday world, but there’s certainly a tipping point. Picking the right pond can even help you get the benefits jerks get. Kissing your boss’s ass isn’t immoral or unsavory if the boss is someone you actually respect. At that next job interview find out who you will be reporting to. Ask to speak to that person and do some research on them. Studies show that your boss has a much larger affect on your happiness and success than the company at large. RULE

As historians such as Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson10 and Joseph Tainter11 have argued, it is the nature of human problem-solving institutions, rather than the nature of the problems themselves, that determines whether societies fail or succeed. Breaking smart at the level of individuals is what leads to organizations and nations breaking smart, which in turn leads to societies succeeding or failing.

This general principle of fertility-seeking has been repeatedly rediscovered and articulated in a bewildering variety of specific forms. The statements have names such as the principle of least commitment (planning software), the end-to-end principle (network design), the procrastination principle (architecture), optionality (investing), paving the cowpaths (interface design), lazy evaluation (language design) and late binding (code execution). While the details, assumptions and scope of applicability of these different statements vary, they all amount to leaving the future as free and unconstrained as possible, by making as few commitments as possible in any given local context.

Science fiction writer Douglas Adams reduced the phenomenon to a set of three sardonic rules from the point of view of users of technology: Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. Anything that’s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the natural order of things.

While research in this arena is formally referred to by the utterly intimidating name “terror management theory,” a study by the more endearing moniker of “The Scrooge Effect” shows that when you take a little time to think about death, you become more kind and generous to others. You put aside short-term goals for a moment and consider who you really want to be. It sounds morbid, but people who contemplate the end actually behave in healthier ways—and therefore may actually live longer. It also has been shown to increase self-esteem. You want to talk about “big picture” thinking? It doesn’t get bigger than this. We’re talking about stuff like fate and destiny.

By engaging in cognitive reappraisal, and telling ourselves a different story about what is happening, we can subvert the entire willpower paradigm. Some research has shown that willpower is like a muscle, and it gets tired with overuse. But it only gets depleted if there’s a struggle. Games change the struggle to something else. They make the process fun, and as Mischel showed in his research, we are able to persist far longer and without the same level of teeth-gritting willpower depletion.

Take that 5 to 10 percent of your time and treat it the way a venture capital firm handles money. VC firms invest in things that have a comparatively low chance of success but, if successful, could turn into something really, really big. They put money in ten companies expecting seven to go bust, two to break even, and one to be the next Google or Facebook.

When you think you and your partner are “made for each other,” it’s easy to assume you don’t have to work at the relationship. And in an era when divorce is easy and options seem plentiful, it’s not surprising that divorce—the relationship equivalent of quitting—is so common. You wouldn’t say “I got my dream job. Whew, now I can stop working,” but people frequently do something akin to this with relationships because it’s “meant to be.” Until it turns out it wasn’t.

Why might this be the case? The answer is a bit frightening, actually. Research shows that you don’t actually need to know more to be seen as a leader. Merely by speaking first and speaking often—very extroverted behavior—people come to be seen as El Jefe. Meanwhile, other studies show that those who initially act shy in groups are perceived as less intelligent. As Pfeffer pointed out, to get ahead you need to self-promote. This comes naturally to extroverts and is actually more important than competence when it comes to being seen as a leader.

coup de grâce. Extroverts are happier than introverts. And this is no small detail: “The relationship between extraversion and happiness or subjective well-being (SWB) is one of the most consistently replicated and robust findings in the SWB literature.” In fact, extroverts are even happier than introverts when alone, and one study showed that when introverts pretend to be extroverts, they were happier too.

Why are mentors so important? You don’t have time to make all the mistakes yourself, and of course making those mistakes can mean failure. It’s better to let others make those mistakes and you can learn from them. Great mentors and great teachers help you learn faster. Even in high school, the right teacher makes a huge difference. Stanford economist Eric Hanushek says that bad teachers cover six months of material in one year. Great teachers cover a year and a half. That math isn’t hard to decode, folks.

Research from neuroscience confirms this. When people are riled up about something and you show them evidence that conflicts with what they believe, what does an MRI scan show? The areas of their brain associated with logic literally shut down. The regions associated with aggression light up. As far as their brain is concerned, it’s not a rational discussion—it’s war. The brain can’t process what you’re saying; it’s just trying to win. Your head works the same way unless you make an effort to control it.

To always feel like you’re awesome you need to either divorce yourself from reality or be on a treadmill of constantly proving your value. At some point you won’t measure up, which then craters your self-esteem. Not to mention relentlessly proving yourself is exhausting and unsettling.

Conversely, the less stuff people owned and the more they spent on experiences like travel or learning new skills, the happier and more content they were. Possessions give you an initial burst of dopamine that fades as your nucleus accumbens acclimatizes, causing you to continuously chase that high.

Remember when I said if you made too much money you couldn’t contribute to a Roth IRA? That’s only partly true. If you make too much money to shelter any funds in a Roth IRA, you can still contribute that amount into a nondeductible traditional IRA. A traditional IRA saves you from paying taxes when you contribute but adds them to your taxable income when you withdraw. A nondeductible traditional IRA takes away the first part: the tax savings on contribution.

Rich people understand this, and they also understand that property tax is a wealth tax that they can’t get around. That’s why rich people tend not to hold a lot of their net worth in their primary residence, whereas middle-class people often do (one reason why it’s hard to break out and become rich).

As Michelangelo once said, “If people knew how hard I worked to achieve my mastery, it wouldn’t seem so wonderful after all.” In Benjamin Bloom’s classic study of top athletes, scientists, and artists, he found that one of the critical elements of a great mentor wasn’t just secret knowledge and emotional support; it was pushing you harder. A great mentor’s “expectations and demands were constantly raised until they were at a point where the student was expected to do virtually all that was humanly possible.”

One narcissist I used to work with, Steve, (actually had all of the dark tetrad characteristics, so I’ll be referring to him throughout the book) used to have this joke. Say he’d gone for a meeting with an attractive colleague. If you were to say something like ‘So, do you think she was attracted to you?’, he would always say ‘She’s not made of plastic, is she?’

If you ‘suffer’ clinically from narcissism then in a way you are lucky because you will have a natural tendency to think highly of yourself, even to be self-obsessed, which is the extreme opposite of most beta nice guys who spend most of their time wondering why they don’t measure up, why they’re “not good enough.”

The first thing you need to do is to get over your distaste at becoming narcissistic. One thing that I have learned from living in London for a long time, having sex with girls here, and working at large corporations is this: everyone else is “bigging” themselves up, especially in big cities, and no-one is going to big you up too unless you do so yourself.

“I’m as good as anyone else out there. In fact there are some areas where I am better than other people. Maybe I’m funnier / more intelligent / better read. But unless I show supreme confidence in this in a very obvious, public way then I’m inevitably going to be overlooked. Brand-building is king just like it is in business, and if I don’t build a brand that shouts that I am brilliant then I am simply going to get passed over in the sexual marketplace for other men. Therefore I am going to tactically embrace narcissism as a way to raise me above others because actually, I deserve it. Why should that other guy get a look-in when I don’t, just because he’s cockier than I am. Fuck that – I’m going to be cockier than him and everyone else that I come into contact with.”

You can do affirmations to increase narcissism. Try it. How about every morning as you walk to work (or in the car) you say to yourself ‘I am incredibly arrogant’ ten times. Then say ‘I am supremely narcissistic’ ten times. Out loud if possible. Then say ‘I am better than everyone else’ ten times, out loud. Then say ‘I am fucking awesome’ out loud, ten times. You can make up your own. You get the idea. These are some of the ones I use personally.

Co-dependents—that is, people who become too reliant on others, too intertwined with them—are the opposite of people who are detached and uncaring. As such, techniques and advice for coping with co-dependency show people ways they can ‘let go with love’ and detach from others who might be harmful to them. It’s entirely unintended, but this same advice can help you build up a psychopathic-style shield.

The way I think we can use this ethically without harming anyone is to show the glint of our steel. A flash of the eyes, a cheeky raise of the eyebrows showing that we’re no-one’s fool and we’re not afraid to walk if someone treats us disrespectfully. Of course, if you’re spinning plates by seeing other girls then this will be so much easier as the loss of one won’t have so much of an impact. In this area the implication speaks so much more loudly than the actuality.

Psychopathy is a condition that affects certain people and not others. That’s the way it is. But the brain is very powerful, and will-power, can be very powerful too. So sometimes I will choose to think like a psychopath. If, for example, I have to send an email that won’t be received well, or if I have to give someone some bad news, I will consciously think, ‘Look, I’m feeling bad about this because my empathy is relatively intact, but there are other guys out there who wouldn’t give a shit. They’d just send the damn email. Because they’re psychos. And if they can take that action why can’t I?’ That seems to help, as crazy as it may sound.

But as you will no doubt be aware by now, women often say things that they don’t mean. So while yes, it’s unlikely that the girl of your dreams is going to want a perfumed fop as a lover, if you can subtly demonstrate that you think a great deal of yourself, and ideally that you think more of yourself than you do of her, then you will be on your way to turning her on. Yes, she might find you annoying and frustrating. But remember that creating any reaction at all is better than being bland and forgettable. After all, women are emotional creatures who thrive on emotional drama. If you can provide that, even in a small way then you further your cause.

It matters. More than you think. It influences your decisions even when you don’t realize it. When I spoke to Duke professor Dan Ariely he said: One of the big lessons from social science in the last forty years is that environment matters. If you go to a buffet and the buffet is organized in one way, you will eat one thing. If it’s organized in a different way, you’ll eat different things. We think that we make decisions on our own, but the environment influences us to a great degree. Because of that we need to think about how to change our environment.

This is where you can actually use being reactive to your advantage. Shawn Achor recommends the “twenty second rule.” Make the things you should do twenty seconds easier to start and make the things you shouldn’t be doing twenty seconds harder. Sounds tiny but it makes a big difference. By rearranging your workspace so temptations aren’t visible, you can trick yourself into making better choices. Ariely told me of a simple study done at Google’s New York office. Instead of putting M&M’s out in the open, they put them in containers. No big deal. What was the result? People ate three million fewer of them in a single month. So close that web browser. Charge your phone on the other side of the room.

Cal Newport recommends a “shutdown ritual” in which you take the time to close out the day’s business and prepare for tomorrow. Research shows that writing down the things you need to take care of tomorrow can settle your brain and help you relax. As neuroscientist Daniel J. Levitin explains, when you’re concerned about something and your grey matter is afraid you may forget, it engages a cluster of brain regions referred to as the “rehearsal loop.” And you keep worrying and worrying. Writing your thoughts down and making a plan for tomorrow switches this off.

SIDEFIRE Financial independence is a suit of armor: by shielding you from running out of money, it allows you to fearlessly follow your dreams. That shield is useful even if you’re not 100 percent financially independent. For example, if you’ve always dreamed of becoming a writer but couldn’t support yourself on a writer’s salary (which is pretty common), by making $20,000 per year as a freelance writer, you’ve reduced your required portfolio size by $20,000 × 25 = $500,000. This is what we like to call SideFIRE. By having a side hustle in “retirement,” you don’t have to become fully FI before reaping most of the benefits. You can build the life of your dreams using the power of a side hustle and have your portfolio supplement your living expenses. In the example I just gave, your portfolio would cover half of your $40,000-per-year expenses and your side-hustle income would cover the other half. By developing a side hustle while you’re working, you essentially kill three birds with one stone: you increase your savings rate by making more money, develop a new skill, and reduce the size of the portfolio needed to escape your nine-to-five. Returning to the example of the couple earning a median family income of $62,175 per year before taxes, if they manage to earn $20,000 a year with a part-time job or side hustle after leaving their jobs, they would only need $40,000 − $20,000 = $20,000 per year in passive income from their portfolio. Using the 4 Percent Rule, that means they would only need $20,000 × 25 = $500,000 to achieve SideFIRE. If they save 24 percent of their after-tax income, here’s what the math looks like: Year Starting Balance Annual Contribution Return (6%) Total 1 $0.00 $12,724.00 $0.00 $12,724.00 2 $12,724.00 $12,724.00 $763.44 $26,211.44 3 $26,211.44 $12,724.00 $1,572.69 $40,508.13 4 $40,508.13 $12,724.00 $2,430.49 $55,662.62 5 $55,662.62 $12,724.00 $3,339.76 $71,726.38 6 $71,726.38 $12,724.00 $4,303.58 $88,753.96 7 $88,753.96 $12,724.00 $5,325.24 $106,803.20 8 $106,803.20 $12,724.00 $6,408.19 $125,935.39 9 $125,935.39 $12,724.00 $7,556.12 $146,215.51 10 $146,215.51 $12,724.00 $8,772.93 $167,712.44 11 $167,712.44 $12,724.00 $10,062.75 $190,499.19 12 $190,499.19 $12,724.00 $11,429.95 $214,653.14 13 $214,653.14 $12,724.00 $12,879.19 $240,256.33 14 $240,256.33 $12,724.00 $14,415.38 $267,395.71 15 $267,395.71 $12,724.00 $16,043.74 $296,163.45 16 $296,163.45 $12,724.00 $17,769.81 $326,657.26 17 $326,657.26 $12,724.00 $19,599.44 $358,980.70 18 $358,980.70 $12,724.00 $21,538.84 $393,243.54 19 $393,243.54 $12,724.00 $23,594.61 $429,562.15 20 $429,562.15 $12,724.00 $25,773.73 $468,059.88 21 $468,059.88 $12,724.00 $28,083.59 $508,867.47 By working on a side hustle to generate $20,000 a year, the couple can shave nine years off their time to financial independence. Remember how I said even when I succeeded in becoming a novelist, the pay was still not enough to live on? Five thousand to $10,000 per year sounds like chump change if you’re trying to live on it, but if you have achieved SideFIRE and this is your supplemental income, it becomes significant. That’s $5,000 of passive income you don’t have to generate. According to the 4 Percent Rule, that means you can decrease the portfolio you need to escape from your job by a whopping $125,000. Think about how much time it would take for you to save that much money. This is why side hustles, by themselves, are not super useful for your financial freedom, but coupled with a portfolio spinning off passive income, they can make all the difference in the world. And if your side hustle has to do with your passion, it’s a triple win, because it decreases the size of the portfolio you need, lets you follow that passion, and generates additional income. You don’t need a million to break free. You simply need a portfolio big enough to supplement the income you’re making in retirement. Check out Grant Sabatier’s book Financial Freedom and Chris Guillebeau’s The $100 Startup for ideas on how to make money on side hustles.

While traveling in Vietnam and Thailand, we realized that due to the advantageous exchange rate, you can live a luxurious life there for as little as $1,130 USD per month, or $13,560 USD per year. Since the average salary in Vietnam is around $150 USD per month, this is an exorbitant amount by local standards. In order to raise $13,560 per year in passive income, you’d need a portfolio size of $13,560 × 25 = $339,000.

Unless you go the extra mile and do your own research, the only information you’re usually given about saving for the long haul is to invest a certain portion of your annual salary into a retirement account like a 401(k) (if your company provides one) or an IRA (individual retirement account). And because most of us aren’t taught any more than that, we don’t know enough to question this advice. We assume if everyone else is doing it, and everyone else seems to be chugging along just fine, then it’s good enough for us.

That being said, one of the cornerstones of my own financial freedom strategy was figuring out ways to earn more money rather than simply focusing on ways to save it. Instead of spending all my time pinching pennies, I spent it looking for ways to make more money. If you are making $25,000, then I want to help you make $50,000, or if you are making $50,000, I want to help you make $100,000. And so on. The more money you make, the more money you can invest, and the faster you will reach financial freedom.

The younger you are, the more time and likely energy you’ll have, so you can always go back to work or supplement your investment withdrawals (by doing something you love doing). Or if you can build some side or passive income streams, or work part time, then you can “retire” from the job you don’t like and work on one you do, even if it pays a lot less money.

The key is to never touch your investment principal and withdraw only as little of your investment growth as you need to live on, but never all of it. If you can continue this pattern of withdrawing less than your returns year after year, then not only will you be living off your investment growth, but the total value of your investments could also easily double, triple, or quadruple over the following years.

working an additional twenty years! Of course, this is a hypothetical scenario, but it illustrates the point that because of compounding, you do in fact need less money to retire the younger you are—as long as you keep some of your investment gains compounding.

Although over the long term the stock market tends to experience average annual gains of 6 to 7 percent, it can fluctuate greatly from year to year—up 20 percent one year and down 11 percent the next.

that number. But for even the best planners, coming up with an exact target for your expected annual expenses in the future is unrealistic. The finance industry often sells a level of precision with investing and retirement planning that’s really just guessing. They also don’t focus on helping you determine how much money it would take to live a life you love, because you’re the only one who can really do that. This is why I recommend you approach this more holistically, finding the amount of money you need to live today and adjusting it once a year as you change and grow.

For example, I spent over $350 a month in takeout food in 2017, so if that expensive habit continues, I will need: $350 month × 12 months = $4,200 per year × 25x = $105,000. In other words, I’ll need $105,000 saved to support this habit for the rest of my life. If I could just cut this figure down to $200 per month, then I would need: $200 month × 12 months = $2,400 per year × 25x = $60,000, or $45,000 less. Any type of recurring expense increases your number. Keep this in mind as you read through the book and work to reduce your expenses.

Using a really simple calculation (and one of the most valuable in personal finance) known as the present value formula, which measures the time value of money, you can measure how much you need to invest today to get the $80,000 over the next fifteen years: PV (present value) = amount of money you need to invest to get to your goal FV (future value) = how much money you need for college tuition (e.g., $80,000) r = investment growth rate adjusted for inflation (e.g., 7 percent expressed as 1.07) n = number of years for the money to grow (e.g., 15 years) So for this example, PV = $80,000(1/(1.07)^15) = $28,995.68.

When our kids are upset, or just to make them happy, we buy too many overpriced toys they don’t need. When we get sick, we head to the store to buy cough syrups and vaporizers, or to the doctor to get medications that mask our symptoms, but don’t solve the root cause. We medicate so we can keep moving—which ends up causing more health issues and being more expensive over time—instead of resting. When you do need something, searching for free alternatives, asking your friends or family for help, or bartering can save you money. There is almost always a cheaper—or, in many cases, free—way if you get creative. It just comes down to how much you really want to save. For example, if you need a dress for a party, you can borrow one from a friend for free, rent one, or buy a used dress instead of buying it new. I recently bartered with my dog boarder for an entire week of dog boarding (a $400 value) by helping her with her Facebook ad campaign; it took me only about thirty minutes. I built a simple website for my barber in a few hours in exchange for free haircuts ($240 value). It’s a win-win. If you actually step back and ask yourself what you really need, what really brings joy to your life, you’ll be better able to spend money mindfully and with intention. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t buy a beautiful vintage Mercedes, stay in five-star hotels, or splurge on designer shoes if those things bring you joy; it just means you will spend less money in other areas that aren’t as important to you, and that you will need to account for these things when calculating your annual expenses. If you’re making $30 per hour after taxes and want to buy a $60,000 car, you’re going to be trading 2,000 of the premium hours of your life for that vehicle. If you work forty hours a week, that’s fifty weeks—an entire year—you need to work to buy that car. If that car is worth a year of your life, then great; just realize the trade-off you are making. Also realize that the $60,000 car actually costs more than $60,000 because you lose the opportunity to invest that money for your future self. At 7 percent compounding, that $60,000 would be worth $120,579 in ten years, $242,324 in twenty years, and $486,989 in thirty years! Is that $60,000 car today worth having to save $486,989 more to hit your number? That $60,000 vintage car is actually costing you $486,989 in the future. So you are actually trading 2,000 hours of your life AND over $400,000 in growth potential. I would rather have the money in the future, but your choice is up to you. Double your money with the Rule of 72. A simple way to estimate how much something will be worth at 7 percent compounding is to use the rule of 72, in which you divide 72 by your expected compounding rate (7 percent) to determine how many years it would take for your money to double. At 7 percent compounding, 72/7 percent = 10.2 years, so at that compounding rate, your money will double every ten years. Thus, if you invested the $60,000 instead of buying the new car, your money would be worth $120,000

Financial freedom comes down to being honest with yourself about what really brings you joy and what’s important to you. Spend money on what you really value and save on what you don’t. Everything else—what your friends do, or your neighbors buy, or your parents say, or your coworkers splurge on—is just noise. There will always be some shiny new thing to buy (our entire economy depends on our buying stuff!), but if you spend money only on what’s important to you, you’ll spend less and reach financial independence faster.

I also log into my investment accounts and look at how my portfolio performed the previous day. Then I analyze how much I spent the day before and how much I’ve spent so far this month to see if I’m sticking to my spending goals; I look at how much money I’ve made from all of my income streams (including my investments) to see if my savings goals are on track. I also check my bank and credit card accounts to make sure nothing is off, like extra or fraudulent charges or weird fees, or if I haven’t received a payment I am owed. Finally, I spend a couple of minutes thinking about additional ways I can make money. Can I find a new client this week? Can I sell a new project to an old client? Does anyone I know need some extra help? The whole process takes about five to ten minutes, but the habit is one of the most important things I do each day. When I see how my money is growing, I get excited and want to figure out how to make more. When it’s not growing or my cash flow is low, it gives me motivation to go out and make more money.

While you can invest in anything, I’ve found stock, bond, and real estate investing to be the most manageable and dependable investments. Invest as much money as quickly as possible.

As you make more money in your full-time job and launch side hustles, your real hourly rate will change, so, as in the case of your net worth, it’s important to calculate and monitor regularly.

Because these recruiters specialize in your industry and are close to the market, they can tell you based on your experience and skills how much you can and should be getting paid. Ask the recruiter specifically what the salary range is for someone with your skills, then print out their messages and put them in your case-making folder. I recommend talking to at least two or three recruiters at different firms because they will have different viewpoints; thus you’ll have multiple salary reference points to include in your analysis.

Just to keep you at your company, your boss might give you a 5 percent raise, but if you want 10 percent or more you will need to make a compelling case using the data you’ve gathered. You can also take more risks if you have another position lined up. I personally believe that 10 to 15 percent is the perfect amount to ask for unless you are being wildly underpaid based on your market and company value. If you do find that you are really underpaid (to the tune of 20 percent or more), then you can go in with your research and ask for a raise that pays you at least the market rate for your position. Ask for the upper bounds of the salary range.

If you’ve done all the research and are determined to ask for a raise, the next step is to think about the actual timing. The best times to ask for a raise are during your annual performance review, at the end of your company’s fiscal year (if you don’t know when this is, you can ask HR), after your workload has increased because of recent employee turnover, or after you’ve spearheaded a company initiative that turned out to be a huge success.

Another good time is if your responsibilities have significantly changed or your workload has increased because of employee turnover or consolidation. Under these circumstances, the last thing your company wants is another employee to leave, so they might pay you more to keep you. Likewise, if you launched an initiative or project that is now a big success, now is another good time to ask. Ride on your accomplishments.

Research shows that the best time to ask for a raise is Friday morning. The reason is because your boss is, like you, relatively relaxed and excited about the weekend. Psychology research also shows that people tend to be more generous in the morning before noon.

Once you’re in the meeting, start the conversation by telling your boss how much you enjoy working for him or her and the company. Share something that really excites you about a project or the direction of the company. By doing this, you put the company (and your boss) first in the conversation. Next, explain why you are asking for a raise: “Recently because of x, y, and z, my responsibilities have really increased” or “I was recently analyzing my market value based on my experience” or “I was recently contacted by a recruiter who said that based on my experience, she could get me a position making $X.” Then go for the ask. Say something like “I would really like to stay here, and I see a bright future here, so I’d like to ask for a raise of x percent.” Don’t talk too much or oversell it.

Brandon, who reached financial independence at thirty-two and is now thirty-six, keeps 100 percent of his portfolio invested in stocks because he is still making money from his blogging side hustle and he’s confident in the long-term prospects of the U.S. stock market. As I write this at thirty-two, I also still have 100 percent of my investments in stocks for a similar reason: I am still making money and also believe in the long-term growth of the stock market. If I didn’t have any additional income, then I would likely switch to a more conservative allocation closer to 70 percent stocks and 30 percent bonds. There is no hard-and-fast rule—your target asset allocation will fluctuate as you invest more money and your plans change.

After you determine your target allocation, you should maintain it across all of your investment accounts. This doesn’t mean that if your target asset allocation is 60 percent stocks/40 percent bonds that you have to have 60 percent stocks/40 percent bonds in every investment account; it just means that your total allocation across all accounts hits those target percentages. You could have 100 percent of your 401(k) in stocks and 80 percent of your IRA in bonds, but it could average out to 60 percent/40 percent depending on the amount of money you’ve invested in each.

This is why it’s important to rebalance four times a year. Simply sell some of the assets you have too much of (in this case, stocks) and use that money to purchase more of the assets you should have more of to get back to your target asset allocation. In this case, you could also buy more bonds to rebalance. In many cases, it’s always better to buy more of an asset to rebalance, since you are investing more money and don’t have a potential tax consequence for selling your investments. However, if you do decide to sell your investments to rebalance, you should do it within your tax-advantaged accounts so you won’t have to pay taxes on the selling and repurchasing of stocks or bonds.

Remember, even a small difference in fees can make a massive difference over time, so any fee over 0.30 percent should be reevaluated, since there are likely more affordable but similar investment options you could choose. In some cases, as with your 401(k), the fees are determined by the company your employer chooses to administer the plan, so you likely won’t be able to reduce them. But if the fees are high, definitely talk to the human resources department at your company to see what they can do.

The older I get, the more important socially responsible investing is becoming to me, so I’ve started to shift some of my own investments into funds designed for socially responsible investing, like Vanguard’s FTSE Social Index Fund (VFTSX). A good ETF to take a look at is the iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (DSI). While you are going to sacrifice some returns and the fees are a bit higher with these funds than they are with a total stock index or S&P 500 fund, it might help you sleep better at night knowing that you are investing only in companies that are doing good in the world, or at least not doing bad. Socially responsible investing is becoming easier, as more funds are being launched regularly, but as with any investment, make sure you do your homework and understand the return trade-offs you are making.

As long as you’ve held the stock long enough (length depends on the stock), then some of the dividends might be what are known as qualified dividends, which get taxed at the capital gains tax rate, which is often lower than your income tax rate.

You can buy your first property with a down payment of as little as 1 to 5 percent, which for a $200,000 home is between $2,000 and $10,000. And in most cities in the United States, the rent-to-buy break-even point (i.e., the point at which it’s equally expensive to buy a home or rent one) is 2.1 years. This means if you plan to live in a home for at least 2.1 years, it often makes sense for you to buy it.

Not only do these deductions help you save money on taxes, but any improvements you make will help make the property more valuable. One note: If you live in a really expensive area where the property taxes are high, you can’t deduct more than $10,000, which means owning a property could get expensive. But for most real estate owners and investors, these tax deductions really add up and make homeownership more affordable by decreasing your tax bill.

But what’s his true secret? Market timing? Good money management? A knack for finding good tenants and real estate gems? Sure. He was smart about all those things. But I think his real secret was this: beans now, steak later. If you have a mortgage, you have debt, and when you have debt, you don’t get to have steak. The steak comes later. It’s your reward. That’s the kind of man I admire. I love how he became incredibly rich through diligence. I love how he used the bank’s rules to his advantage and beat them at their own game.

The reason why so many common life principles don’t apply to the world of investing is very simple: The short-run performance of the stock market is random, unpredictable, and for most people, nerve-racking. The next time you hear someone saying that he/she knows how the stock market or any given stock is going to perform in the next few weeks, months, or years, you can be sure they are either lying or self-delusional.

Another important point to keep in mind: It’s common for actively managed funds to have great before-tax returns and not-so-great after-tax returns, due to the trading that goes on in actively managing the funds. For that reason, we recommend keeping any actively managed funds in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts, such as 401(k)s, SEPs, Keoghs, or Roth IRAs.

The only certainty in investing is that past performance will not repeat. Let’s assume your goal is to save for retirement. After careful consideration of all the factors we’ve discussed here, you and your spouse agree on a portfolio allocation of stocks and bonds that seems about right for you. Congratulations! You’ve just made your most important portfolio decision. Subdividing Your Stock Allocation It’s important for maximum diversification that our stock allocation contain various subcategories. This is because different types of stocks perform differently at different times. No investor wants to own a portfolio that has all of its equity investments in an underperforming asset class. Accordingly, we want to have some exposure to as many different types of stocks as is reasonably practical. Morningstar’s Style Box, Table 8.3, is a useful tool that shows how your portfolio’s equity holdings are divided between the different styles and sizes. You can use the Style Box to analyze your portfolio at no charge at www.morningstar.com. You will find it listed under “Tools/X-Ray.” We will use the Style Box to show the style and capitalization size of the stocks in one fund—Vanguard’s Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX). We choose this fund because it closely approximates the entire U.S. stock market, based on the market value of each stock, and also because many investors choose this one fund for their entire domestic stock allocation. Table 8.3 Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Breakdown (February 2014) Value Core Growth   24% 24% 25% Large 6% 6% 6% Medium 3% 3% 3% Small Morningstar’s Style Box is particularly useful for investors using multiple stock funds so that the total allocation in all funds in the portfolio does not unintentionally overweight or underweight any particular style (value, core, growth) or market capitalization (large, medium, small). If you look closely at Table 8.3, you will notice that large-cap stocks dominate the U.S. stock market. Many investors believe that overweighting value and small-cap stocks may result in less volatility and higher long-term returns. This can be accomplished by adding a value and/or a small-cap fund to a total market index fund.

Next, as a rule it is better to buy and sell in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid creating taxable events. I recommend this unless you happen to have capital losses in a given year. Then it is best to take them in your taxable accounts when possible.

For instance, you might own VTSAX in both an IRA and in a taxable account. Should you need to sell to rebalance that year, sell in the taxable account to capture the loss. You can deduct it against any other gain you happen to have, including any capital gain distributions. You can also deduct up to $3,000 against your earned income. Any loss left over you can carry forward to use in future years.

It is worth noting that there are strategies which seek to access this money tax-free, or at least at the lowest possible rate. These involve structuring your earned and investment income so as to fall under the limits the IRS establishes as being tax-free. So while the money you withdraw is legally subject to tax, your tax bracket is such that the actual amount owed is zero. Staying under these limits can also provide the opportunity to shift money tax-free over time from your Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA (this is sometimes called a Roth Conversion Ladder), thus further avoiding taxes when you withdraw and spend it. These are well worth considering if your situation allows for them.

Roth 401(k) These are relatively new and not yet widely available. It is worth comparing these bullet points to those of the Roth IRA we’ll discuss shortly.

So in theory, at least, our reflection on our past behavior could lead to learning, self-knowledge, and a desire to behave differently in the future. In theory, we could resolve not to repeat the same mistakes we made in the past. Alas, Smith says we are not always “quite candid” when we reflect on our past behavior. An honest assessment of our behavior is often too hard to bear:

Not surprisingly, we find it much easier to see the moral imperfections in others than our own shortcomings. Smith is warning us about that asymmetry. One way to correct that imbalance comes from the Baal Shem Tov, the great Jewish mystic and founder of the Hasidic movement, who died the year after The Theory of Moral Sentiments was first published. He said that we notice the flaws in those around us to remind us of our own flaws and to spur us to self-improvement. Our flawed neighbors are the mirror that allows us to see our own imperfections and ideally to remedy them. So when you see the annoyance of a co-worker over something trivial, instead of being surprised that he or she is so sensitive to so minor a slight, ask yourself if there are times when you get annoyed over something silly and unimportant. When your son is impatient, reflect on your own impatience and try to help your son by showing him you can control yourself.

I used to think the reason people use selfless-sounding language to describe what are in fact selfish actions is to make others think they’re selfless. It’s a form of advertising. We want to be loved, so we couch our desires in a selfless form. We cloak our selfishness in something that looks more like kindness.

Taleb, who has surveyed the territory of self-deception in a trio of books, quotes a Venetian proverb in his 2012 book, Antifragile: “The sea gets deeper as you go further into it.” The more you know, the more you realize how much there is to know.

But we don’t just struggle to be lovely and to perceive ourselves honestly. Smith also argues that our desire to be loved has its own pitfalls.

Use the idea of an impartial spectator to step outside yourself and see yourself as others see you. Use that vision to know yourself.

As adults, we have a similar set of rules about what is proper that we rarely think about consciously. When a friend comes back from vacation, you ask her about her trip. When a friend has a worried look on his face, you ask him if anything is wrong. When a stranger on the subway has a worried look, you don’t say anything. But if a stranger looks lost and disoriented, it’s OK to offer to help. When you’re in Rome, do as the Romans do. When you’re in Santiago, learn the expectations of your housekeeper and try to meet them.

The gap between my sentiments and yours is much more consequential, says Smith, when it’s a personal example, as opposed to your feelings about a poem, a song, or a work of art. It’s much more important to me that you like my friends than my favorite poems. I want you to like my friends and dislike my enemies. But I can live with the fact that you don’t like my friends as much as I do or even that you don’t befriend them at all. I care more, says Smith, that you dislike my enemies.

Part of the comfort we receive from a friend comes from experiencing our pain through the friend’s eyes. Because the friend is less pained than we can be, we are less pained. We watch our friend watching us, and seeing ourselves through our friend’s eyes lessens the tragedy. That’s a friend; at the next level is an acquaintance, and then finally a stranger. As we move further and further away from a friend or loved one, we realize that those around us have only modest sympathy for our situation:

Smith’s emphasis on the importance of not deviating from the rules related to justice—always pay your debts, never steal, never betray your spouse—is a crucial aspect of confronting our self-deception. Once we decide that these rules can be relaxed in special circumstances, we’re on the road to finding ways to convince ourselves that what is good for me is good for you, too. Then there will be “no enormity so gross of which we may not be capable.” That’s not a mild warning; it’s a blaring siren.

When my kids were young, I read a parenting book that encouraged you to always take your child’s hand when it’s offered. There will come a day when your child will be too old or too self-conscious to hold a parent’s hand, and you’ll regret the times you failed to enjoy the moment. After reading that, I created a beneficent rule that was a little bit challenging—I always took my daughter’s or son’s hands when they were offered. Not only did that rule mean holding their hands more often than I otherwise would have, I usually remembered to savor the moment. And I was more likely to reach my hand out for theirs.

If you want to make the world a better place, work on being trustworthy, and honor those who are trustworthy. Be a good friend and surround yourself with worthy friends. Don’t gossip. Resist the joke that might hurt someone’s feelings even when it’s clever. And try not to laugh when your friend tells you that clever joke at someone’s expense. Being good is not just good for you and those around you, but because it helps others be good as well. Set a good example, and by your loveliness you will not only be loved, but you may influence the world. I

By reminding us of the perils of the man of system, Smith is reminding us to be wary of hubris. We think we can move those chess pieces where we want. We think we know what’s best for them. Smith is saying that even when we’re right, even if we think we know what’s best for others, sometimes it’s best to leave them alone, because our efforts won’t just fail or fall short of the idea. Sometimes they’ll do more harm than good. Sometimes it’s best to walk away from the board and set our sights on smaller, better fields of play than the chessboard of society.

The four fundamental principles of value investing as created by Ben Graham are as follows:    1.  Treat a share of stock as a proportional ownership of the business.    2.  Buy at a significant discount to intrinsic value to create a margin of safety.    3.  Make a bipolar Mr. Market your servant rather than your master.    4.  Be rational, objective, and dispassionate.

The Graham value investing system is intentionally designed to underperform an index in a bull market; this is confusing to many people. The underperformance of the Graham value investing system during a bull market is an essential part of this style of investing. By giving up some of the upside in a bull market, the Graham value investor is able to outperform when the market is flat or down. Consider what Seth Klarman wrote in Margin of Safety: “Most investors are primarily oriented toward return, how much they can make and pay little attention to risk, how much they can lose.”4 He added, “The payoff from a risk-averse, long-term orientation is—just that—long term.”

Here is a story to further illustrate this point. An investor was walking in a park one day when she saw a frog sitting on a log at the edge of a pond. The frog looked right at her and said, “Excuse me, would you happen to be an investor?” The investor replied, “Yes, I am. Why do you ask?” “Well,” replied the frog, “I am a stock speculator. My best client did not like my investing results so he put a spell on me and now I am a frog. The spell can be broken if an investor will kiss me.” The investor immediately reached over and picked up the frog, put him in her purse, and then started to walk home. The frog was concerned that he was not receiving a kiss and asked, “What are you doing? When do I get my kiss?” The investor replied, “I’m not kissing you ever. You’re worth a lot more to me as a talking frog than as a stock speculator.” If you cannot accept investing underperformance in the short term in order to achieve long-term investment outperformance, then you are not a candidate for Graham value investing. This is not a tragedy, since the Graham value investing system is not the only way to invest successfully. It is important to note that the goal of the Graham value investor is superior absolute performance, not just relative performance. An investor cannot spend the output of relative performance, only actual performance.

Even though passive investors must make some decisions, they are called passive because they do not make as many decisions as active investors. A better approach is perhaps to call these passive investors index investors. If a person is investing in a diversified portfolio of index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), then he is an index investor.

The impact of this simple adaptation, however, can be profound. In this book, you’ll encounter many examples of digital minimalists who experienced massively positive changes by ruthlessly reducing their time spent online to focus on a small number of high-value activities. Because digital minimalists spend so much less time connected than their peers, it’s easy to think of their lifestyle as extreme, but the minimalists would argue that this perception is backward: what’s extreme is how much time everyone else spends staring at their screens.

The so-called digital minimalists who follow this philosophy constantly perform implicit cost-benefit analyses. If a new technology offers little more than a minor diversion or trivial convenience, the minimalist will ignore it. Even when a new technology promises to support something the minimalist values, it must still pass a stricter test: Is this the best way to use technology to support this value? If the answer is no, the minimalist will set to work trying to optimize the tech, or search out a better option.

I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines. They go to bed every night a little wiser than they were when they got up, and boy, does that help, particularly when you have a long run ahead of you. … So if civilization can progress only with an advanced method of invention, you can progress only when you learn the method of learning. Nothing has served me better in my long life than continuous learning. I went through life constantly practicing (because if you don’t practice it, you lose it) the multidisciplinary approach and I can’t tell you what that’s done for me. It’s made life more fun, it’s made me more constructive, it’s made me more helpful to others, and it’s made me enormously rich.

The reason that stocks do better than bonds is not hard to fathom. As companies grow larger and more profitable, their stockholders share in the increased profits. The dividends are raised.

If it came down to a choice between owning Coca-Cola, a 15 percent grower selling at 30 times earnings, and the Body Shop, a 30 percent grower selling at 40 times earnings, I preferred the latter. A company with a high p/e that’s growing at a fast rate will eventually outperform one with a lower p/e that’s growing at a slower rate.

A technique that works repeatedly is to wait until the prevailing opinion about a certain industry is that things have gone from bad to worse, and then buy shares in the strongest companies in the group.

I put Toll Brothers at the top of my Barron’s list in October, expecting to recommend it at the panel in January, but in the meantime the stock quadrupled to $8. (By the time the panel convened, it had reached $12 again.) Here’s a tip from the prospectors of year-end anomalies: act quickly! It doesn’t take long for bargain hunters to find the bargains in the stock market these days, and by the time they’re finished buying, the stocks aren’t bargains anymore.

As for the old reliable indicator, same-store sales, Mr. Johnson reported that in the regions hardest hit by the recession sales were down 9 percent, but in the rest of the country they had increased. In a recession, it’s not unusual for same-store sales to decline, so I took this report as a modest positive. I’d be more worried if the same-store sales had declined in a period of general prosperity for retailers, which this was not.

Whenever I’m evaluating a retail enterprise, in addition to the factors we’ve already discussed I always try to look at inventories. When inventories increase beyond normal levels, it is a warning sign that management may be trying to cover up the problem of poor sales. Eventually, the company will be forced to mark down this unsold merchandise and admit to its problem. At Pier 1, the inventories had increased, but only because the company had to fill the shelves in 25 new stores. Otherwise, they stood at acceptable levels.

One way to estimate the actual worth of a company is to use the home buyer’s technique of comparing it to similar properties that recently have been sold in the neighborhood. Multiplying the $5 share price by the number of Sunbelt shares, 6.2 million, I arrived at the conclusion that the market value for the entire company and its 98 lawn and garden centers was $31 million. (Normally in this exercise you have to subtract the debt, but since Sunbelt had no debt, I could ignore this step.)

When a company buys back shares that once paid a dividend and borrows the money to do it, it enjoys a double advantage. The interest on the loan is tax-deductible, and the company is reducing its outlay for dividend checks, which it had to pay in after-tax dollars. A few years ago, Exxon’s stock was so depressed that it was yielding 8–9 percent. At the time, Exxon was able to borrow money at 8–9 percent to buy back millions of these dividend-paying shares. Since the interest on the loan was tax-deductible, Exxon was really paying only about 5 percent to save 8–9 percent on dividends. This simple maneuver increased the company’s earnings without its having to refine an extra drop of oil.

What you want to see on a balance sheet is at least twice as much equity as debt, and the more equity and the less debt the better. A high debt ratio like this would in some cases be enough to cause me to take the company off the buy list, but there was a mitigating factor: much of this debt was not due for several years, and it was not owed to banks. In a highly leveraged company, bank debt is dangerous, because if the company runs into problems the bank will ask for its money back. This can turn a manageable situation into a potentially fatal one.

How to view the world: See yourself as an explorer. With the gift of consciousness, you stand before a vast and unknown universe that we humans have just begun to investigate. Most people prefer to cling to certain ideas and principles, many of them adopted early on in life. They are secretly afraid of what is unfamiliar and uncertain. They replace curiosity with conviction. By the time they are thirty, they act as if they know everything they need to know.

Your second task is to become aware of the projecting mechanism within yourself. (See the next section for common types of projections.) Projections have a positive role to play in your life, and you could not stop them even if you wanted to, because they are so automatic and unconscious. Without them, you would not find yourself paying deep attention to a person, becoming fascinated with him or her, idealizing, and falling in love. But once the relationship develops, you need to have the power and awareness to withdraw the projections, so that you can begin to see women and men as they really are. In doing so, perhaps you will realize how truly incompatible you are, or the opposite. Once connected to the real person, you can continue to idealize him or her, but this will be based on actual positive qualities he or she possesses. Perhaps you can find his or her faults charming. You can accomplish all of this by becoming aware of your own patterns and the types of qualities you tend to project onto others.

Your third task is to look inward, to see those feminine or masculine qualities that are repressed and undeveloped within you. You will catch glimpses of your anima or animus in your relationships with the opposite sex. That assertiveness you desire to see in a man, or empathy in a woman, is something you need to develop within yourself, bringing out that feminine or masculine undertone. What you are doing in essence is integrating into your everyday personality the traits that are within you but are repressed.

Men of this type often had strong mother figures in their childhood. They became good, obedient boys, excellent students at school. Consciously they are attracted to well-educated women, to those who seem good and perfect. But unconsciously they are drawn to women who are imperfect, bad, of dubious character. They secretly crave what is the opposite of themselves. It is the classic split of the mother/whore—they want the mother figure for a wife but feel a much stronger physical attraction to the whore, the Fallen Woman, the type who likes to display her body. They have repressed the playful, sensual, and earthy sides of the character they had as boys. They are too rigid and civilized. The only way they can relate to these qualities is through women who appear to be so different from themselves. Like Swann, they find a way to idealize them with some highbrow reference that has no relation to reality. They project onto such women weakness and vulnerability. They tell themselves they want to help and protect them. But what really attracts them is the danger and naughty pleasures these women seem to promise. Underestimating the strength of such women, they often end up as their pawns. Their anima is passive and masochistic.

Men who engage in this kind of projection need to develop the less conventional sides of their character. They need to move outside their comfort zone and try new experiences on their own. They require more challenges, and even a bit of danger that will help loosen them up. Perhaps they need to take more risks at work. They also need to develop the more physical and sensual side of their character. Not having to get what they crave by looking for the Fallen Woman type, they can actually begin to satisfy their urges with any type of woman, not passively waiting for her to lead them astray but actively initiating the guilty pleasures.

Francisco mentioned "Atlas Shrugged". I would say "Fountainhead" is the superior book. For those who still think narcissism is about being 'selfish', just look at the character of Keating. Keating and Roark play opposite roles. Keating does whatever to please others. He even denies his heart to marry a 'beautiful woman'. Roark does only what pleases himself and pursues his own passions. In the end, Keating becomes broken while Roark wins the world. The point is that both characters face severe pain (for pain will occur to you in life. If anyone tells you differently, they are a salesman). Roark, taking the mindset of freedom, dealt with the pain at front. Keating, adopting the mindset of security, avoids pain at every turn and it ends up consuming him.

So instead of focusing on asking out the chick or talking to the chick, focus on the continuity of it. She will then become just one chick in your routine. You focus on the routine, on the consistency, not on the chick.

I think it is best to treat a chick, no matter how hot and steamy she is, no matter how cute and perfect, as a guy. The only exception is don't talk technical stuff with them like you would with a guy (computers, cars, how to lay chicks, etc.) They will LOVE this. With the girls I like, I talk about THEM and they become more and more attracted to me because guys do not do this.

Duke Ellington, the great jazz artist and a consummate seducer, would initially dazzle the ladies with his good looks, stylish clothing, and charisma. But once he was alone with a woman, he would take a slight step back, becoming excessively polite, making only small talk. Banal conversation can be a brilliant tactic; it hypnotizes the target. The dullness of your front gives the subtlest suggestive word, the slightest look, an amplified power. Never mention love and you make its absence speak volumes—your victims will wonder why you never discuss your emotions, and as they have such thoughts, they will go further, imagining what else is going on in your mind.

Faithful to his method, he noted the stages: “Do not talk too much at present; do not try to talk. But whenever you speak, speak with self-possession. Speak in a subdued tone, and always look at the person whom you are addressing. Before one can engage in general conversation with any effect, there is a certain acquaintance with trifling but amusing subjects which must be first attained. You will soon pick up sufficient by listening and observing. Never argue. In society nothing must be discussed; give only results. If any person differ from you, bow and turn the conversation. In society never think; always be on the watch, or you will miss many opportunities and say many disagreeable things. Talk to women, talk to women as much as you can. This is the best school. This is the way to gain fluency,because you need not care what you say, and had better not be sensible. They, too, will rally you on many points, and as they are women you will not be offended. Nothing is of so much importance and of so much use to a young man entering life as to be well criticised by women. ”

He doesn’t stick his opinion into every discussion. He’s a good friend, but he manages to avoid melodrama in his relationships. His friendships are a “faithful attachment to a few well-tried and well-chosen companions”; he chooses his friends not because they’re cool or have an impressive list of accomplishments, but because they have the “sober esteem of modesty, discretion, and good conduct.”

In particular, Nietzsche wrote about the concept of “self-overcoming,” which is the process of harnessing our inbuilt life energy and drive and focusing it on mastery of the ideal true self. For Nietzsche, a person is made, not born—it is up to us to develop ourselves, to take control and responsibility of our drives, and to strive to create beauty, order, and wellbeing in the world.

For example, you may wake up in the morning and do a brief “body scan” where you check in with yourself and how you feel, as well as take a quiet moment where you examine your emotional state, your thoughts, and so on.

The second issue with liquidity will emerge when those who own these passive investment vehicles start selling in panic. An index fund or ETF will then be forced to unload the respective assets it owns in order to return the capital to the investor or to lower its market exposure. In a bear market, there will be nobody on the other side of such a trade, especially as everyone will know that ETFs are forced to sell. Thus, we can expect much bigger stock market declines in the future than what we have seen in the last 20 years.

To “learn the ropes,” I was accompanying a company realty salesman on a weekend of showing houses to prospective home buyers. The salesman—we can call him Phil—was to give me tips to help me through my break-in period. One thing I quickly noticed was that whenever Phil began showing a new set of customers potential buys, he would start with a couple of undesirable houses. I asked him about it, and he laughed. They were what he called “setup” properties. The company maintained a run-down house or two on its lists at inflated prices. These houses were not intended to be sold to customers but to be shown to them, so that the genuine properties in the company’s inventory would benefit from the comparison. Not all the sales staff made use of the setup houses, but Phil did. He said he liked to watch his prospects’ “eyes light up” when he showed the place he really wanted to sell them after they had seen the run-down houses. “The house I got them spotted for looks really great after they’ve first looked at a couple of dumps.”

“No psychic powers; I just happen to know how several of the big toy companies jack up their January and February sales. They start prior to Christmas with attractive TV ads for certain special toys. The kids, naturally, want what they see and extract Christmas promises for these items from their parents. Now here’s where the genius of the companies’ plan comes in: They undersupply the stores with the toys they’ve gotten the parents to promise. Most parents find those things sold out and are forced to substitute other toys of equal value. The toy manufacturers, of course, make a point of supplying the stores with plenty of these substitutes. Then, after Christmas, the companies start running the ads again for the other, special toys. That juices up the kids to want those toys more than ever. They go running to their parents whining, ‘You promised, you promised,’ and the adults go trudging off to the store to live up dutifully to their words.”

Despite the fact that the caller started each type of interaction with a warm and friendly comment, the “How are you feeling” technique was, by far, superior to its rival (33 percent vs. 15 percent compliance), because it alone drew an exploitable public commitment from its targets.

Be imaginative about them, maybe including a little visual of her taking a picture of you with her cell phone and then blogging or tweeting about it—things that make it as visceral and painful as possible. I want you to go into your first approaches with the thought that everyone will erupt in laughter, most especially the girl. You’ll accept the emotionally painful outcome, take a deep breath, and then proceed with the approach anyway, because you’re a man who wants to get laid.

Another potential opener is to ask her to watch your stuff while you go to the bathroom. When you return, ask if she had to fight anyone off to protect your valuables. I especially like this opener when I’m in a foreign city. Let me share an example. I look to the girl next to me in the coffee shop and say, “Excuse me, can you watch my things while I use the bathroom?” “Yeah, sure.” I take my time using the bathroom, but not too much time or she may think I have diarrhea. I return and say, “Thank you for watching my things.” “No problem,” she says. “Did anyone try to steal my laptop while I was gone?” I say with a slight smile. She laughs. “Oh, no.” “Is it safe to leave things here? I read that Denmark is the safest country in the world and that you can basically leave your front door open with a sack of money within view and not have it stolen.” (If I was in Brazil I’d take the opposite route and say how I heard it’s the most dangerous country in the world.)

The “Excuse me, where did you get that?” opener is powerful in that it can be used anywhere, especially when there are no props, but it’s a little harder to pull off if you can’t ramble about the particular object. After opening, a follow-up can be about how you saw something similar in a foreign country you traveled to. An example: “I thought you may have bought that in Chicago. When I was up there I saw a lot of people wearing that type of hat.” Or your follow-up can be about how you’ve been unable to find a similar item for a female relative. Say, “I have a cousin who’s about your age with similar style, and I think she’d like that. Do you get a lot of compliments on it?”

If there are a pair of girls who are hanging out in the coffee shop, an easy opener is to eavesdrop on their conversation, wait until they hit a generic topic you know something about (or want to know something about), and then say, “Excuse me, I couldn’t help overhearing your conversation. Is it true that…” and then ask a question about what they were talking about. This

Even if you ask a girl, “Do you like it when a man you just met at a bar touches your waist?” most girls would still say no, even though it’s an effective move that helps escalate night encounters. (If you re-word the question to, “Do you like it when a man you like touches your arm lightly?” the numbers will change drastically.)

Slouching is also common, but leaning even more so. It’s as if some force causes men to bend at the hip toward women, even early in the conversation. I’ve noticed a strong correlation between leaners and soft talkers, as if they’re hoping that leaning will make it easier for a girl to hear them. If anything it creeps them out. Talk loud, stand up straight, and keep your hands at your sides (ready to gesticulate when you want to stress something interesting or important). Maintain a neutral expression on your face unless you’re tossing out obvious humor.

Understand that you’ve had unique experiences and accomplishments that others haven’t. A woman wants to hear about them. She wants to hear about the interesting things you’ve noticed, the journeys you’ve taken, and the hobbies you participate in. It’s not your fault that she’ll become interested in you in the process. You’re not bragging—you’re just throwing things out there, and you can’t help the fact that she wants to dig in for more details. But if you don’t bring up the cool things you’ve done, how will she ever know about them? You have to go above and beyond what the conversation calls for because she won’t ask you to tell her about your experiences and hobbies. You must do it on your own.

Thankfully, food cravings naturally subside when our stomachs feel full (otherwise our stomachs might explode). But phones and most apps are deliberately designed without “stopping cues” to alert us when we’ve had enough—which is why it’s so easy to accidentally binge. On a certain level, we know that what we’re doing is making us feel gross. But instead of stopping, our brains decide the solution is to seek out more dopamine. We check our phones again. And again. And again.

Let’s start with a question: have you ever wondered why social media apps are all free? It’s not because their creators are driven by a philanthropic urge to help the world share selfies. It’s because we are not actually the customers, and the social media platform itself is not the product. Instead, the customers are advertisers. And the product being sold is our attention.

To be clear, there is nothing wrong with spending your attention on social media (or on any other app). There is also nothing wrong with a designer trying to make an app that’s fun, engaging, and profitable. But as users, we should be using our apps because we’ve made a conscious choice to do so—not because of manipulative psychological tricks that are meant to make money for someone else.

The amount of information that Facebook has about its users is truly shocking—García Martínez refers to Facebook as “the regulator of the biggest accumulation of personal data since DNA.” What most of us don’t realize is that Facebook doesn’t just know everything you do and share on Facebook. Thanks to Facebook buttons and cookies (small files left behind on your computer that make it possible for companies to track your activities across sites), Facebook also knows many of the websites you’ve visited, apps you’ve used, and links you’ve clicked on. And thanks to partnerships with external data-collection companies such as Equifax, it knows countless details about your offline life, too, including (but not limited to!) your income and basically every purchase you’ve ever made with a card.

But that’s not how it works. When we store a long-term memory, it doesn’t exist on its own in a manila folder in our brain. It exists in a network of other connected memories. Called “schemas,” these networks help us make sense of the world by linking every piece of new information that we acquire to information that we already have. Schemas explain why a single stimulus—say, the smell of a cake baking—can trigger a flurry of memories.

As Brewer explains in The Craving Mind, most addictions stem from a desire to feel better and/or to make a bad feeling go away. If you try to cut back on your phone use without first figuring out what you’re trying to achieve or avoid, you’re dooming yourself to failure. Either you’re going to relapse, or you’re going to find another, potentially more destructive habit that achieves the same effect.

The point is not to punish yourself. We’re trying to resolve discrepancies between how we say we want to live our lives, and how we are actually living our lives. Sure, there may be some uncomfortable moments along the way, but ultimately, breaking up with your phone should make you feel good. If you start feeling like all you’re doing is saying “no” to yourself, then take a step back to regroup. Our goal isn’t abstinence; it’s consciousness.

This is the equivalent of dumping someone because you say you want a “better relationship”—but, when pressed, admitting that you actually have no idea what that better relationship would look like. If you don’t take the time to figure that out, you are highly likely to end up in a relationship that’s just as unsatisfying or unhealthy as the one that you just got out of.

To summarize briefly: A white rabbit is pulled out of a top hat. Because it is an extremely large rabbit, the trick takes many billions of years. All mortals are born at the very tip of the rabbit’s fine hairs, where they are in a position to wonder at the impossibility of the trick. But as they grow older they work themselves ever deeper into the fur. And there they stay. They become so comfortable they never risk crawling back up the fragile hairs again. Only philosophers embark on this perilous expedition to the outermost reaches of language and existence. Some of them fall off, but others cling on desperately and yell at the people nestling deep in the snug softness, stuffing themselves with delicious food and drink. “Ladies

Avoid tribal identification. Put truth above social approval. [11] Study logic and math, because once you’ve mastered them, you won’t fear any book.

When solving problems: the older the problem, the older the solution. If you’re trying to learn how to drive a car or fly a plane, you should read something written in the modern age because this problem was created in the modern age and the solution is great in the modern age. If you’re talking about an old problem like how to keep your body healthy, how to stay calm and peaceful, what kinds of value systems are good, how you raise a family, and those kinds of things, the older solutions are probably better.

We are highly judgmental survival-and-replication machines. We constantly walk around thinking, “I need this,” or “I need that,” trapped in the web of desires. Happiness is the state when nothing is missing. When nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and stops running into the past or future to regret something or to plan something.

Happiness is the state when nothing is missing. When nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and stops running into the past or future to regret something or to plan something. In that absence, for a moment, you have internal silence. When you have internal silence, then you are content, and you are happy. Feel free to disagree. Again, it’s different for everybody.

To me, happiness is not about positive thoughts. It’s not about negative thoughts. It’s about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things. The fewer desires I can have, the more I can accept the current state of things, the less my mind is moving, because the mind really exists in motion toward the future or the past. The more present I am, the happier and more content I will be. If I latch onto a feeling, if I say, “Oh, I’m happy now,” and I want to stay happy, then I’m going to drop out of that happiness. Now, suddenly, the mind is moving. It’s trying to attach to something. It’s trying to create a permanent situation out of a temporary situation.

There’s a line from Blaise Pascal I read. Basically, it says: “All of man’s troubles arise because he cannot sit in a room quietly by himself.” If you could just sit for thirty minutes and be happy, you are successful. That is a very powerful place to be, but very few of us get there.

Socially, we’re told, “Go work out. Go look good.” That’s a multi-player competitive game. Other people can see if I’m doing a good job or not. We’re told, “Go make money. Go buy a big house.” Again, external multiplayer competitive game. Training yourself to be happy is completely internal. There is no external progress, no external validation.

Do you think there’s some loss aversion there? Because once you diverge, you’re not sure if you’re diverging toward a positive outcome or a negative outcome? Absolutely. I think that’s why the smartest and the most successful people I know started out as losers. If you view yourself as a loser, as someone who was cast out by society and has no role in normal society, then you will do your own thing and you’re much more likely to find a winning path. It helps to start out by saying, “I’m never going to be popular. I’m never going to be accepted. I’m already a loser. I’m not going to get what all the other kids have. I’ve just got to be happy being me.”

I hate wasting time. I’m very famous for being rude at parties, events, dinners, where the moment I figure out it’s a waste of my time, I leave immediately. Value your time. It is all you have. It’s more important than your money. It’s more important than your friends. It is more important than anything. Your time is all you have. Do not waste your time.

I think everybody has values. Much of finding great relationships, great coworkers, great lovers, wives, husbands, is finding other people where your values line up. If your values line up, the little things don’t matter. Generally, I find if people are fighting or quarreling about something, it’s because their values don’t line up. If their values lined up, the little things wouldn’t matter.

It is like dividing a deck of cards into two piles, Sophie. You lay the black cards in one pile and the red in the other. But from time to time a joker turns up that is neither heart nor club, neither diamond nor spade. Socrates was this joker in Athens. He was neither certain nor indifferent. All he knew was that he knew nothing—and it troubled him. So he became a philosopher—someone who does not give up but tirelessly pursues his quest for truth.

There are three fundamental practices to help liberate us from these three wrong views: the concentrations on emptiness, signlessness, and aimlessness. They are known as the Three Doors of Liberation and are available in every school of Buddhism. These three concentrations offer us a deep insight into what it means to be alive and what it means to die. They help us transform feelings of grief, anxiety, loneliness, and alienation.

As you breathe in and out, imagine someone playing a very long note on a violin, drawing the bow back and forth across the string. The note sounds continuous. If you were to draw an image of your breath, it would look like a figure eight, not a straight line, because there is continuity as your breath flows in and out. Your breathing becomes the music itself. Breathing like this is mindfulness, and as you sustain mindfulness, that is concentration. Wherever there is concentration, there is insight—a breakthrough—bringing more peace, understanding, love, and joy into your life.

We have to train ourselves to sustain the insight of emptiness while we’re looking at a person, a bird, a tree, or a rock. It’s very different from just sitting there and speculating about emptiness. We have to really see the nature of emptiness, of interbeing, of impermanence, in ourselves and others.

The ability to approach this state is the goal of the Inner Game. The development of inner skills is required, but it is interesting to note that if, while learning tennis, you begin to learn how to focus your attention and how to trust in yourself, you have learned something far more valuable than how to hit a forceful backhand. The backhand can be used to advantage only on a tennis court, but the skill of mastering the art of effortless concentration is invaluable in whatever you set your mind to.

Getting it together mentally in tennis involves the learning of several internal skills: 1) learning how to get the clearest possible picture of your desired outcomes; 2) learning how to trust Self 2 to perform at its best and learn from both successes and failures; and 3) learning to see “nonjudgmentally”—that is, to see what is happening rather than merely noticing how well or how badly it is happening. This overcomes “trying too hard.” All these skills are subsidiary to the master skill, without which nothing of value is ever achieved: the art of relaxed concentration.

The image comes to my mind of the balanced movement of a cat stalking a bird. Effortlessly alert, he crouches, gathering his relaxed muscles for the spring. Not thinking about when to jump, nor how he will push off with his hind legs to attain the proper distance, his mind is still and perfectly concentrated on his prey. No thought flashes into his consciousness of the possibility or consequences of missing his mark. He sees only bird. Suddenly the bird takes off; at the same instant, the cat leaps. With perfect anticipation he intercepts his dinner two feet off the ground. Perfectly, thoughtlessly executed action, and afterward, no self-congratulations, just the reward inherent in his action: the bird in the mouth.

Read this simple analogy and see if an alternative to the judging process doesn’t begin to emerge. When we plant a rose seed in the earth, we notice that it is small, but we do not criticize it as “rootless and stemless.” We treat it as a seed, giving it the water and nourishment required of a seed. When it first shoots up out of the earth, we don’t condemn it as immature and underdeveloped; nor do we criticize the buds for not being open when they appear. We stand in wonder at the process taking place and give the plant the care it needs at each stage of its development. The rose is a rose from the time it is a seed to the time it dies. Within it, at all times, it contains its whole potential. It seems to be constantly in the process of change; yet at each state, at each moment, it is perfectly all right as it is.

Through this experience, I began to see how Self 1 operated. Always looking for approval and wanting to avoid disapproval, this subtle ego-mind sees a compliment as a potential criticism. It reasons, “If the pro is pleased with one kind of performance, he will be displeased by the opposite. If he likes me for doing well, he will dislike me for not doing well.” The standard of good and bad had been established, and the inevitable result was divided concentration and ego-interference.

Three men in a car are driving down a city street early one morning. For the sake of analogy, suppose that each man represents a different kind of tennis player. The man sitting on the right is a positive thinker who believes that his game is great and is full of self-esteem because his tennis is so superior. He’s also a self-admitted playboy who enjoys all “the pleasures” life has to offer. The man sitting in the middle is a negative thinker who is constantly analyzing what is wrong with himself and the world. He is always involved in some kind of self-improvement program. The third man, who is driving, is in the process of letting go of judgmental thinking altogether. He plays the Inner Game, enjoying things as they are and doing what seems sensible. The car pulls up at a stoplight, and crossing the street in front of the car is a beautiful young lady who catches the attention of all three men. Her beauty is particularly apparent as she is stark naked! The man on the right becomes engrossed in thoughts of how nice it would be to be with this lady under other circumstances. His mind races through past memories and future fantasies of sensual pleasures. The man sitting in the middle is seeing an example of modern decadence. He’s not sure that he should be looking closely at the girl. First miniskirts, he thinks, then topless dancers, then bottomless dancers, and now they’re out on the streets in broad daylight! Something must be done to stop all this! The driver is seeing the same girl that the others are observing, but is simply watching what is before his eyes. He sees neither good nor bad, and as a result, a detail comes to his attention which was not noticed by either of his companions: the girl’s eyes are shut. He realizes that the lady is sleepwalking. Responding immediately with common sense, he asks the person next to him to take the wheel, steps out of the car, and puts his overcoat over the woman’s shoulders. He gently wakes her and explains to her that she must have been sleepwalking and offers to take her home.

The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains of Neanderthals and Sapiens.1

Whichever way it happened, the Neanderthals (and the other human species) pose one of history’s great what ifs. Imagine how things might have turned out had the Neanderthals or Denisovans survived alongside Homo sapiens. What kind of cultures, societies and political structures would have emerged in a world where several different human species coexisted? How, for example, would religious faiths have unfolded? Would the book of Genesis have declared that Neanderthals descend from Adam and Eve, would Jesus have died for the sins of the Denisovans, and would the Qur’an have reserved seats in heaven for all righteous humans, whatever their species? Would Neanderthals have been able to serve in the Roman legions, or in the sprawling bureaucracy of imperial China? Would the American Declaration of Independence hold as a self-evident truth that all members of the genus Homo are created equal? Would Karl Marx have urged workers of all species to unite?

The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using an altogether new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation.

Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. According to this theory Homo sapiens is primarily a social animal. Social cooperation is our key for survival and reproduction. It is not enough for individual men and women to know the whereabouts of lions and bison. It’s much more important for them to know who in their band hates whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest, and who is a cheat.

Most likely, both the gossip theory and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory are valid. Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.

Such companies were legally independent of the people who set them up, or invested money in them, or managed them. Over the last few centuries such companies have become the main players in the economic arena, and we have grown so used to them that we forget they exist only in our imagination. In the US, the technical term for a limited liability company is a ‘corporation’, which is ironic, because the term derives from ‘corpus’ (‘body’ in Latin) – the one thing these corporations lack. Despite their having no real bodies, the American legal system treats corporations as legal persons, as if they were flesh-and-blood human beings.

Yet when it succeeds, it gives Sapiens immense power, because it enables millions of strangers to cooperate and work towards common goals.

On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and corporations.

If she says something along the lines of “You're so bad," and starts hitting you, then you know you are onto a winner. Other signs are her telling you that she loves your sense of humour. If she falls right into line and starts talking about sex, then you are already in the end-zone and can celebrate appropriately. Slowly but surely, the defences will eventually begin to drop, because a girl has to imagine all the sex-jokes in her mind in order to understand them. Although she might be disgusted or repelled at first, the more her mind is bombarded with sexual references, the more her imagination will take control.

Social proof techniques only work if feel confident, otherwise they will have more of a negative effect, since it will look more like attention seeking behaviour. When joining a conversation for example, always pay attention to the feet of the group. If people turn their feet towards you (and subsequently their whole body) they are inviting you to join in the conversation. If their feet do not point towards you and only turned at the torso, they are just waiting for you to interject a quick statement and leave, so they can continue their conversation. This pretty much means you are not welcome. You will notice that this more often than not holds true and works in groups of two to four people. Regardless whether you are in the back break room, at a birthday party, or an evening function, it is usually done subconsciously by those involved, but is a wonderful social cue to walk away instead of making the situation awkward for all involved.

When talking to people, even doing something like nodding and motioning your arms like ‘the thinker’ will make people talk more openly to you because they feel more confident and intelligent. What they are saying is suddenly more profound and interesting because you have to "think about it". Just the act of you simulating a "contemplation" during their dialogue goes miles in how they will engage you. People will be more inclined to talk to you about stuff they normally would not, because you are giving them a response they want. If you are quiet and respond calmly when they ask you questions, this also makes you appear more wise. And sooner or later, they will be asking you for advice and sharing more secrets.

Some people suggest that compliments are validation currency - the more you dish out, the less worth each individual one has. The moment you start thinking about them as currency, they are devalued. If your girl looks good in a dress, say something. Do not sit on it because you might "over validate her". That is just hardcore over thinking.

The following is a template for success which you can use when it is your turn to speak, in just about any type of gathering, formal or informal. 1. The Greeting "Good..." The greeting is the easy part. You begin by simply wishing your audience a good morning, afternoon, evening, or whatever time of day it is. “Good evening everybody...” 2. State the Event "As we all know..." The second part is also very easy: You simply state the obvious and remind everybody what the purpose of the event or celebration is, and what you are all doing there. “As we all know, we are here to celebrate the marriage of John and Kate, and to show them our support as they begin their journey of love and life together..” Now the ball is rolling, and the words are coming out easily. You look like you know what you are doing up there, and people are listening. So now, it is time to.... 3. Establish Common Ground "We have all..." It is important to include your audience as part of the message you are delivering. Talk about something both yourself and your audience can relate to regarding the event or celebration. “We have all* had the wonderful opportunity to get to know John and Kate and enjoy watching their love develop...” 4. State Why You're Speaking "I..." Include a personal account, or tell a brief story to let people know why you specifically are talking. What gives you the right to be speaking..? “I have* personally been very lucky to have John as a close friend of mine, and it has been quite amazing to watch how he has grown as a person, and could not be more pleased for him to have found someone like Kate to go about his life with...” 5. Call for Action "So let's all..." Finally, close your speech with a call for action. This lets everybody know that you are finished without you having to awkwardly say "That's it!" or "I'm finished, thank you"...which is how every weak speech is concluded, and always makes the audience uncomfortable. You should say something like "So let's all raise a glass to John and Kate, and wish them well. Cheers!" or, So Let's all give a big round of applause to Mark for the outstanding job he's done while working with the company"

There can wisely be no ‘solutions’, no self-help, of a kind that removes problems altogether. What we can aim for, at best, is consolation – a word tellingly lacking in glamour.

To hear that we should understand rather than condemn, that others are primarily anxious rather than cruel, that every strength of character we admire bears with it a weakness we must forgive: these are both key laws of psychology and entirely familiar truisms of the sort that we have been taught to disdain. Yet despite their so-called obviousness, simple-sounding emotional dynamics are aggressively capable of ruining extended periods of our lives. Three decades devoted to the unhappy pursuit of wealth and status may turn out to be driven by nothing more or less than a forgotten desire to secure the attention of a distracted parent more interested in an older sibling. The failure of a fifteen-year relationship, a thousand nights of pain and fury, might have originated in an avoidant pattern of attachment established in one’s fourteenth month on earth. Emotional life is never done with showing us how much we might have to suffer for ‘small’ things.

Much of what destroys our lives can be attributed to emotions that our conscious selves haven’t found a way to understand or to address in time. It is logical that Socrates should have boiled down the entire wisdom of philosophy to one simple command: ‘Know yourself.’

One kind of person, the bearer of a solid emotional inheritance, will tend to be resilient when someone hurts or behaves badly towards them. It won’t be a catastrophe, just a few unpleasant moments. But such a verdict would feel entirely alien to someone who has been bequeathed a backdrop of shame and self-contempt, always looking to reconfirm itself in contemporary incidents.

But such a verdict would feel entirely alien to someone who has been bequeathed a backdrop of shame and self-contempt, always looking to reconfirm itself in contemporary incidents. Maturity involves accepting with good grace that we are all – like marionettes – manipulated by the past. And, when we can manage it, it may also require that we develop our capacity to judge and act in the ambiguous here and now with somewhat greater fairness and neutrality.

The imbalances go in endless directions. We are too timid or too assertive; too rigid or too accommodating; too focused on material success or excessively lackadaisical. We are obsessively eager around sex or painfully wary and nervous in the face of our own erotic impulses. We are dreamily naive or sourly down to earth. We recoil from risk or embrace it recklessly. We emerge into adult life determined never to rely on anyone or are desperate for another to complete us. We are overly intellectual or unduly resistant to ideas. The encyclopedia of emotional imbalances is a volume without end.

The truth is likely to be more hopeful – though, in the short term, a great deal more uncomfortable. We are a certain way because we were knocked off a more fulfilling trajectory years ago. In the face of a viciously competitive parent, we took refuge in underachievement. Having lived around a parent disgusted by the body, sex became frightening. Surrounded by material unreliability, we had to overachieve in relation to money and social prestige. Hurt by a dismissive parent, we fell into patterns of emotional avoidance. A volatile parent pushed us towards our present meekness. Early overprotectiveness inspired timidity and, around any complex situation, panic. A continually busy, inattentive parent was the catalyst for a personality marked by exhausting attention-seeking behaviour.

Similarly, because children cannot easily leave an offending situation, they are prey to powerful, limitless longings to fix the broken person they so completely depend on. It becomes, in the infantile imagination, the child’s responsibility to mend the anger, addiction or sadness of the grown-up they adore. It may be the work of decades to develop a wiser power to feel sad about, rather than eternally responsible for, those we love but cannot change. And perhaps, at points, in the interests of self-preservation, to move on.

It is another feature of the emotional wounds of childhood that they tend to provoke what are in effect large-scale generalizations. Our wounds may have occurred in highly individual contexts: with one particular adult who hit his particular partner late at night in one particular terraced house in one town near the border. Or the wound may have been caused by one specific parent who responded with intense contempt after a specific job loss in one specific factory. But these events give rise to expectations of other people and life more broadly. We grow to expect that everyone will resort to violence, that every partner may turn on us and every money problem will unleash disaster. The character traits and mentalities that were formed in response to one or two central actors of childhood become our habitual templates for interpreting pretty much anyone. The always jokey and slightly manic way of being that we evolved so as to keep a depressed, listless mother engaged becomes our second nature. Even when she is long gone, we remain people who need to shine at every meeting, who require a partner to be continually focused on us and who cannot listen to negative or dispiriting information of any kind. We are living the wide-open present through the narrow drama of the past.

The damage may have begun with a feeling of invisibility, a poignant enough phenomenon, but to the world that doesn’t care to know more, we now just come across as somewhat sickening in our search for attention. Maybe the damage began with a truly unwarranted let-down, but now we simply appear unreasonable and controlling. Perhaps it started with a bullying, competitive father; now it seems as if we are just spineless. We make our lives tougher than they should be because we insist on thinking of people, ourselves and others, as inept and mean rather than, as is almost invariably the case, primarily the victims of what we have all in some ways travelled through: an immensely tricky early history.

With age, we naturally look at the world through the eyes of an adult rather than going to the trouble of recovering the distinctive and peculiar perspective of the child. To any grown-up, it is immediately obvious that a three-year-old having a tantrum in a hotel restaurant is irritating, theatrical and bad-mannered. But that is chiefly because we lack the encouragement or empathetic energy to try to recreate the strange inner world of a small person in which she might feel monumentally tired and bewildered, fearful that an unfamiliar dish was going to be forced on her, or lonely and humiliated by being the smallest person in a large and lugubrious dining room, far away from Lanky, the stuffed rabbit left by mistake on the floor in the room upstairs.

We lie by pretending that we are simpler than we actually are and that too much psychology might be nonsense. We lean on a version of robust common sense to ward off intimations of our own awkward complexity. We imply that not thinking very much is, at base, evidence of a superior kind of intelligence.    In company, we deploy bluff strategies of ridicule against more complex accounts of human nature. We sideline avenues of personal investigation as unduly fancy or weird, implying that to lift the lid on inner life could never be fruitful or entirely respectable. We use the practical mood of Monday morning 9 a.m. to ward off the complex insights of 3.a.m. the previous night, when the entire fabric of our existence came into question. Deploying an attitude of vigorous common sense, we strive to make our moments of radical disquiet seem like aberrations, rather than the central occasions of insight they might actually be.    We appeal to the understandable longing that our personalities be non-tragic, simple and easily comprehended, so as to reject the stranger but more useful facts of our real, intricate selves.

In an emotionally healthy childhood, someone will put themselves profoundly at our service. If as adults we have even a measure of mental health, it is almost certainly because, when we were helpless infants, there was a person (to whom we essentially owe our lives) who pushed their needs to one side for a time in order to focus wholly on ours. They interpreted what we could not quite say, they guessed what might be ailing us, they settled and consoled us. They kept the chaos and noise at bay and cut the world up into manageable pieces for us.    They did not, all the while, ask that we thank them, understand them or show them sympathy. They didn’t demand that we enquire how their days went or how they were sleeping at night (they weren’t much). They treated us like royalty, so that we would later on be able to submit to the rigours and humiliations of an ordinary life. This temporarily one-sided relationship guaranteed our eventual ability to form a two-sided kind.    We may think of egoists as people who have grown sick from too much love, but in fact the opposite is the case: an egoist is someone who has not yet had their fill. Self-centredness has to have a clear run in the early years if it isn’t to haunt and ruin the later ones. The so-called narcissist is simply a benighted soul who has not had a chance to be inordinately and unreasonably admired and cared for at the start.

In an emotionally healthy childhood, we’re given the benefit of the doubt. We are assessed by what we might one day be, not by exactly what we are right now. Someone is on hand to put the best possible spin on our behaviour. Someone is kind.    A harsh judge might, for example, say that we were ‘attention-seeking’. Our caregiver imagines that we just stand in need of some encouraging words. We might have acted rather meanly. Our caregiver adds that we must, in the background, have been feeling threatened. It looked as if we were negligent; the caregiver remembers that tiredness might account for the lion’s share of the explanation.    Our carer constantly searches beneath the surface for a more sympathetic set of reasons. They help us to be on our own side, to like ourselves and therefore, eventually, not to be too defensive about our own flaws, the existence of which we grow strong enough to accept.

What helps enormously in our attempts to know our own minds is, surprisingly, the presence of another mind. For all the glamour of the solitary seer, thinking usually happens best in tandem. It is the curiosity of someone else that gives us the confidence to remain curious about ourselves. It is the application of a light pressure from outside us that firms up the jumbled impressions within. The requirement to verbalize our intimations mobilizes our flabby reserves of concentration.

By their questions and their attention, their careful probing and investigative stealth, the therapist tries – harder than anyone may yet have done – to discover how our presenting problem might be related to the rest of our existence and, in particular, to the turmoils of childhood. Over many sessions, a succession of small discoveries contributes to an emerging picture of the sources of our emotional wounds and of the way in which our character evolved defences in response to them in a manner that hampers our possibilities today.

But it is no good stating any of this too starkly. An interpretation – delivered in its bare bones – will be anticlimactic and bathetic and most likely prompt resistance or aggression. For the interpretation to work its effect, we as clients need to move from merely assenting to it intellectually to having an internal experience of the emotions it refers to. We need to feel for ourselves, rather than take on trust, the poignant drama undergone by the person we once were. There is, in this setting, no point in being too clever.

We will have to re-experience at a novelistic level of detail a whole set of scenes from our early life in which our problems around fathers and mothers and authority were formed. We will need to let our imaginations wander back to certain moments that have been too unbearable to keep alive in a three-dimensional form in our active memories (the mind liking, unless actively prompted, to reduce most of what we’ve been through to headings rather than the full story, a document which it shelves in remote locations of the inner library). We need not only to know that we had a difficult relationship with our father, but to relive the sorrow as if it were happening to us today. We need to be back in his book-lined study when we were not more than six; we need to remember the light coming in from the garden, the corduroy trousers we were wearing, the sound of our father’s voice as it reached its pitch of heightened anxiety, the rage he flew into because we had not met his expectations, the tears that ran down our cheeks, the shouting that followed us as we fled out into the corridor, the feeling that we wanted to die and that everything good was destroyed. We need the novel, not the essay.

To keep this idea at the front of the collective imagination, the ancient Greeks developed a particular art form: tragic drama. They put on huge festivals, which all the citizens were expected to attend, to act out stories of appalling, often grisly, failure: people were seen to break a minor law, or make a hasty decision, or sleep with the wrong person and the results were ignominy and death. Yet what happened was shown to be to a large extent in the hands of what the Greeks called ‘fate’ or ‘the gods’. It was the Greeks’ poetic way of saying that things often work out randomly, according to dynamics that simply don’t reflect the merits of the individuals concerned.

At the heart of the shy person’s self-doubt is a certainty that they must be boring. But, in reality, no one is ever truly boring. We are only in danger of coming across as such when we don’t dare (or know how) to communicate our deeper selves to others. The human animal witnessed in its essence, with honesty and without artifice, with all its longings, crazed desires and despair, is always gripping. When we dismiss a person as boring, we are merely pointing to someone who has not had the courage or concentration to tell us what it is like to be them. But we invariably prove compelling when we succeed in detailing some of what we crave, envy, regret, mourn and dream. The interesting person isn’t someone to whom obviously and outwardly interesting things have happened, someone who has travelled the world, met important dignitaries or been present at critical geopolitical events. Nor is it someone who speaks in learned terms about the great themes of culture, history or science. They are someone who has grown into an attentive, self-aware listener and a reliable correspondent of their own mind and heart, and who can thereby give us faithful accounts of the pathos, drama and strangeness of being them.

They hover as the other speaks: they offer encouraging little remarks of support, they make gentle positive gestures – a sigh of sympathy, a nod of encouragement, a strategic ‘hmm’ of interest. All the time they are egging the other to go deeper into issues. They love saying, ‘Tell me more about …’; ‘I was fascinated when you said …’; ‘Why did that happen, do you think?’ or ‘How did you feel about that?’ The good listener takes it for granted that they will encounter vagueness in the conversation of others. But they don’t condemn, rush or get impatient, because they see vagueness as a universal and highly significant trouble of the mind that it is the task of a true friend to help with. Often, we’re in the vicinity of something but we can’t quite close in on what’s really bothering or exciting us. The good listener knows we benefit hugely from encouragement to elaborate, to go into greater detail, to push a little further. We need someone who, rather than launch forth, will simply say two rare, magic words: ‘Go on.’ We mention a sibling and they want to know a bit more. What was the relationship like in childhood? How has it changed over time? They’re curious about where our concerns and excitements come from. They ask things like, ‘Why did that particularly bother you?’ ‘Why was that such a big thing for you?’ They keep our histories in mind; they might refer back to something we said before and we feel they’re building up a deeper base of engagement. It’s fatally easy to say vague things: we simply mention that something is lovely or terrible, nice or annoying. But we don’t really explore why we feel this way. The good listener has a productive, friendly suspicion of some of our own first statements and is after the deeper attitudes that are lurking in the background. They take things we say like, ‘I’m fed up with my job’ or ‘My partner and I are having a lot of rows …’ and help us to concentrate on what it really is about the job we don’t like or what the squabbles might deep down be about. They’re bringing to listening an ambition to clear up underlying issues.

It is the necessary foundation for a less blithe and presumptuous, more ethical and more careful future. We will henceforth better understand how easily we can damage other people, how unwittingly we can inflict pain, how tragic the mismatch can be between intentions and effect – and from such an awareness will spring ever greater efforts to be, wherever possible, a bit more gentle, tolerant, forgiving, darkly funny and uncomplaining, a bit less self-righteous. Our moments of social catastrophe will reinforce our always fragile but deeply necessary commitment to a life of self-examination, kindness and good manners.

Our degree of satisfaction is critically dependent on our expectations. The greater our hopes, the greater the risks of rage, bitterness, disappointment and a sense of persecution. We are not always humiliated by failing at things; we are humiliated only if we first invested our pride and sense of worth in a given achievement and then did not reach it. Our expectations determine what we will interpret as a triumph and what must count as a failure. ‘With no attempt there can be no failure; with no failure no humiliation. So our self-esteem in this world depends entirely on what we back ourselves to be and do,’ wrote the psychologist William James.

Which is not to say that there aren’t better and worse ways to approach our condition. The single most important move is acceptance. There is no need – on top of everything else – to be anxious that we are anxious. The mood is no sign that our lives have gone wrong, merely that we are alive. We should also be more careful when pursuing things we imagine will spare us anxiety. We can head for them by all means, but for other reasons than fantasies of calm, and with a little less vigour and a little more scepticism. We will still be anxious when we finally have the house, the relationship and the right income. We should at all points spare ourselves the burden of loneliness. We are far from the only ones to be suffering. Everyone is more anxious than they are inclined to tell us. Even the tycoon and the couple in love are in pain. We have collectively failed to admit to ourselves how much anxiety is our default state. We must, when possible, learn to laugh about our anxieties, laughter being the exuberant expression of relief when a hitherto private agony is given a well-crafted social formulation in a joke.

Respecting the special feelings we get around certain people in nightclubs and at train stations, at parties and on websites appears not to have made us any happier in our unions than a medieval couple shackled in marriage by two royal courts keen to preserve the sovereignty of a slice of ancestral land. ‘Instinct’ has been little better than ‘calculation’ in underwriting the quality of our love stories.

Our problems are often generated because we continue to respond to compelling people in the way we learned to behave as children around their templates. For instance, maybe we had a rather irate parent who often raised their voice. We loved them, but reacted by feeling that when they were angry we must be guilty. We got timid and humble. Now if a partner (to whom we are magnetically drawn) gets cross, we respond as squashed, browbeaten children: we sulk, we assume it’s our fault, we feel got at and yet deserving of criticism. But rather than seek radically to re-engineer our instincts, we can try to learn to react to our lovers not as we did as children but in the more mature and constructive manner of a rational adult. There is an enormous opportunity to move ourselves from childlike to more adult patterns of response in relation to the difficulties we are attracted to. Many of us are highly likely to end up with somebody with a particularly knotty set of issues which trigger our desires as well as our childlike defensive responses. The answer isn’t usually to shut down the relationship, but to strive to deal with the compelling challenges it throws up with some of the wisdom we weren’t capable of when we first encountered these in a parent or caregiver.

First, we may become distant – or what psychotherapists call ‘avoidant’. We want to get close to our partners but feel so anxious that we may be unwanted, we freeze them out: we say we’re busy, pretend our thoughts are elsewhere. We could get involved with a third person, the ultimate defensive attempt to be distant – and often a perverse attempt to assert that we don’t require a love we feel too vulnerable to ask for. We grow into avoidant patterns when – in childhood – attempts at closeness ended in degrees of rejection, humiliation, uncertainty or shame that we were ill-equipped to deal with. We became, without consciously realizing it, determined that such levels of exposure would never happen again. At an early sign of being disappointed, we therefore now understand the need to close ourselves off from pain. We are too scarred to know how to stay around and mention that we are hurt. Or else we become controlling – or what psychotherapists calls ‘anxious’. We grow suspicious, frantic and easily furious in the face of the ambiguous moments of love; catastrophe never feels too far away. A slightly distant mood must, we feel, be a harbinger of rejection; a somewhat non-reassuring moment is an almost certain prelude to the end. Our concern is touching, but our way of expressing it often less so, for it emerges indirectly as an attack rather than a plea. In the face of the other’s swiftly assumed unreliability, we complain administratively and try to control procedurally. We demand that they be back by a certain hour, we berate them for looking away from us for a moment, we force them to show us their commitment by putting them through an obstacle course of administrative chores. We get very angry rather than admit, with serenity, that we’re worried. We ward off our vulnerability by denigrating the person who eludes us. We pick up on their weaknesses and complain about their shortcomings. Anything rather than ask the question which so much disturbs us: do you still care? And yet, if this harsh, graceless behaviour could be truly understood for what it is, it would be revealed not as rejection or indifference, but as a strangely distorted – yet very real – plea for tenderness. A central solution to these patterns is to normalize a new and more accurate picture of emotional functioning: to make it clear just how predictable it is to be in need of reassurance – and at the same time, how understandable it is to be reluctant to reveal one’s dependence. We should create room for regular moments, perhaps as often as every few hours, when we can feel unembarrassed and legitimate about asking for confirmation. ‘I really need you. Do you still want me?’ should be the most normal of enquiries. We should uncouple the admission of need from any associations with the unfortunate and punitive term ‘neediness’. We must get better at seeing the love and longing that lurk behind some of our and our partner’s most cold, stern or managerial moments.

Proust tried hard to make sure his readers would not judge Mademoiselle Vinteuil harshly, going so far as to suggest that even the woman’s father wouldn’t ultimately have minded being spat on by her lover, so long as he understood what was really going on: ‘I have since reflected that if Monsieur Vinteuil had been able to be present at this scene, he might still, and in spite of everything, have continued to believe in his daughter’s soundness of heart.’ Proust’s argument is that defilement during sex isn’t what it seems. Ostensibly, it’s about violence, hatred, meanness and a lack of respect. But for Proust, it symbolizes a longing to be properly oneself in the presence of another human being, and to be loved and accepted by them for one’s darkest sides rather than just for one’s politeness and good manners. Mademoiselle Vinteuil is, in her day-to-day behaviour, an extremely moral and kindly character, and yet this pressure to be always responsible and ‘good’ also begs moments of release.

A number of qualities are required to ensure that a couple know how to argue well. There is, first and foremost, the need for each party to be able to pinpoint sources of discomfort in themselves early and accurately: to know how to recognize what they are unhappy about and what they need in order to flourish in the couple. This is not necessarily as obvious as one might imagine. It can take time and psychological insight to know that it was actually the missing phone call or the request to move the date of the holiday that is really the source of anger.

It matters in all this that one both feels attached to the partner and at the same time has an active impression that one could walk away from them were matters ever truly to escalate. Feeling that one has options, does not therefore have to cling and deserves good treatment ensures that one’s voice can be measured and that the status quo will remain manageable. These factors tend to be absent in those unfortunate couples who not only argue but lack the gift of arguing well.

A shamed person has fundamental doubts about their right to exist: somewhere in the past, they have been imbued with the impression that they do not matter very much, that their feelings should be ignored, that their happiness is not a priority, that their words do not count. Once they are part of a couple, shamed people hurt like anyone else, but their capacity to turn their hurt into something another person can understand and be touched by is recklessly weak. Shamed people will sulk rather than speak, hide rather than divulge, feel secretly wretched rather than candidly complain. It is frequently very late, far too late, by the time shamed people finally let their lover know more about the nature of their desperation.

For so-called cheats (who will most likely have to pay a very heavy price indeed for going to bed with another person), sex can have remarkably little to do with ‘sex’. It is an activity continuous with a range of non-physical needs for tenderness, acceptance, care and companionship. It is an attempt, negotiated through the body but focused on the satisfactions of the psyche, to make up for a long-standing painfully severed emotional connection with a primary partner. The crucial, active element in an affair isn’t really the physical sex per se: it’s the sense of closeness, the warmth, the shared liking for which physical sex provides the occasion.

Generally, to be "dominating" in the literal sense of the word, is the equivalent of being a jerk or a douche bag, and much of the time, this only works on girls with low self-esteem. Instead, what you should be aiming for is to be confident and assertive. Being confident and assertive is figuring out what you want from life, and girls will be attracted to that. Unlike other mammals, we as humans do not just have to accept our pack ranks. Get on it, be a doer, live life like the person you want to be and you will find out how to be him. Begin by focussing on you and your future. Your new mantra is "I am a worthwhile person, and I will endeavour to improve myself in all areas". Put yourself in many different situations, and try to be confident about how you carry yourself. Always try to learn from other people and make connections with them. There are various ways to get about to doing this to build up your confidence. One of the most obvious one is working out. Make a daily routine and you will feel much better about yourself and the world around you. Squats especially work out the region where testosterone is produced and are an all body workout.

Try to keep it positive, but remember, negative feelings can be good too. Keep it light and fun and then jump into serious stuff and then back to light and fun. Whatever you do, don’t be boring. Boredom is one of greatest fears in life. Why is that? Because there is no feeling in boredom. Point here is: think about creating some kind of feeling in all of your text messages.

Keep your texts as short as possible spicing it up with wit and other emotionally charged words. Like when I give a girl a compliment, I sort of take it away at the same time or challenge them. I’ll text something like “Yeah you’re fun… so far.” or “You’re actually cute… when you’re not whining.” or in reverse “Stop whining… even if you are good looking.”

How to get the woman to reply back. Remember, more and more women are getting used to flirting with text messages and they will get that you are fun and respond back. In some cases a few women have had some bad experiences with texting, so don’t rely on text messaging for all your communication. But the best way to get a reply is to ask a questions or text something that is fun and flirty that has a pull for her to respond. For example, I text a girl about cooking together one night and here’s how it went: “Hey if you don’t cook you can always watch me cook.” Her response back, “Oh whatever, you haven’t seen me in the kitchen yet.” My response, “Uh, I’m not sure if I should be The Ultimate Texting Guide by Tyler Tray © 2008, All Rights Reserved www.TipsToTexting.com P a g e | 22 scared or turned on.” Her response, “Both.” I didn’t respond back and then ten minutes later she wrote, “So what time are we cooking tonight?”

How do I create closeness and comfort? Speak to her like you’re already friends. Talk to her as if she’s right there. Most women are natural followers and respond to what you do and say. So you must be comfortable in order for the woman to feel comfortable. You can say almost anything to your friends and not worry about what they think ‐ do the same when it comes to women. Listen to her and ask her questions on what she is talking about ‐ this will relax her.

In fact, the word “nice” is the number one word women use when a guy is not right for her, “He was a nice guy, but it wasn’t there.” Since women use the word nice to kindly reject men, then use the word nice when complimenting women. Say, “You’re nice, you’ll make a good friend” or “It was good to hangout with a nice girl.” A woman will recognize it’s a rejection, and she’ll be thrown off when you use it on her.

Here’s an example of a flirty text conversation I had today: “Hey, I know you’re probably out to dinner with the folks instead of me but how are ya?” Most women enjoy going out to eat with friends or family, so this is an easy first text. Her reply, “Lol I’m actually sick in bed… how was your concert?” I had text her the previous day letting her know she is missing out on some fun. I reply with, “Oh that sucks. You’ll get better soon. Just pretend you’ll get something really special from me when you’re better. Like a cookie.” This was long, but I knew I was ending it here. She replies back with “Ha ha that does sound really special!!!” This fun energy can carry over and now I have shaped the way we communicate to each other and we are both enjoying it. She ended up texting me the next day for her cookie.

Women always played house growing up and this is a great way to slide into that role and have fun. By setting up roles, we can now play them out and have those feelings and attitudes associated with them. Women love this. A lot of women also have a naughty side or guilty pleasure to them, so if you let them play out this role they will find you exciting to be around as they are able to express themselves. Example, “I would go shopping with you but I don’t want you to be tempted to make out with me in the dressing room.” Remember, you’re playing with them, having a good time bringing up even the most childlike emotions.

You must learn to only breathe in with your nose. There are filters in the nose that moisten the air as you inhale. This moistened air is easier on the vocal cords and doesn’t dry them out as much. Take a big breath in with your mouth open. Do you feel how all that air makes the back part of your throat dry? It’s really important to start being aware of whether or not you are a mouth breather and alleviate that problem.

It shows that you are picky, you have an opinion, you are a qualifier and you are in control. If she asks, “Do you want to go do this?” and you don’t want to, just say, “no, do you want to?” Or let’s say she wants to meet up and you can’t, instead of saying “oh I can’t sorry” say, “No, next week will be better.” It’s a very powerful word because the word NO internally triggers a challenge.

(Also, I think that many women harbor contempt for their beauty. At a shadow level, they are kept from living a real life and being closer to the real world simply because fewer and fewer people can relate to them in proportion to how ‘beautiful’ they are and make themselves. Addressing this topic when speaking to women is VERY powerful. More later.)

Then, write down three times in your life when you felt each of those states. Finally, close your eyes and put yourself into each of the three situations that made you feel the state that you want. Also, do SOMETHING UNIQUE with your body as you’re remembering. For instance, if you’d like to feel powerful and confident, while you’re remembering times when you felt this way, breathe out quickly while puckering your lips.

Saying or doing things just to be noticed or to get compliments. I’ve known a lot of men who try to act cool or show off to get attention. This approach telegraphs to a woman that you’re insecure and needy. Don’t do it. If you’re cool, she’ll figure it out without you telling her.

Most men who want sex make the mistake of doing things like taking women to dinner, buying them gifts, and being romantic. This behavior triggers the “Hey, this guy is good long-term material” category in the woman’s mind, and they hold back sex. But if a man does things to turn a woman on earlier in the game and she gets sexually involved, he can choose where he wants the relationship to go.

What’s interesting is that because I usually (but not always) do these teasing and seemingly controlling things with a bit of a dry humor spin, I believe that the woman who I’m with has an internal response like, “Wow, this guy is cocky, but I can’t tell if he’s serious or not… and I want to find out… but either way, he’s funny and he’s staying interested in me and not being flagrantly abusive… so he must be interested at SOME level…”

Misinterpret what women say. Always listen for opportunities to misinterpret words. If you say, “Let’s go over to the bar to have a drink” and the woman says, “Let’s do it”, turn to her and say, “Let’s do it? You mean right here? I think the line for a bathroom stall is too long, and I’d rather have a drink.” 4. Look for sexual innuendo in everything and use it to accuse her of trying to seduce you before you even know her. If she says, “Well, I’m getting tired, and I think it’s time for bed”, say, “Bed? I mean, I don’t even know if you know how to kiss... and you’re trying to get me into bed? What happened to the old days when you could be friends first?”

Exaggerate. If an overweight woman walks by, say, “What would you guess? 900 pounds?” Or if a woman complains about a part of her body or her clothing (I love these opportunities), exaggerate it. For instance, if she says, “My hair looks like hell today”, you say, “I didn’t want to say anything.” Ohhhh this is funny stuff. You’ll usually get a hit on the arm (in which case you can spank her on the ass). Then you can go on all night making fun of her hair, talking about how everyone is looking at it, how you’re embarrassed to be seen with her because of it, etc.

The point is relevant not just for a politically excluded minority; it can serve the shy just as well. In the face of the most daunting foreignness, expressed through accents, jobs, in jokes or age, there must remain a common core. We may come from the land of ugly boys while she is a beautiful woman; we may come from the province of the poor while he is a successful moneymaker; we are almost retired and they are starting their twenties. But we must, with Shylock in mind, look beyond the differences and insist on a universal commonality. Shakespeare had read and absorbed the writings of the Roman playwright Terence, who is remembered for one very famous declaration: ‘Homo sum, humani nil a me alienum puto’ (‘I am human, I consider nothing human alien to me’). Shyness is the most modest, kind and unfortunate way of insisting on the specialness of one’s particular province. At the heart of the shy person’s self-doubt is a certainty that they must be boring. But, in reality, no one is ever truly boring. We are only in danger of coming across as such when we don’t dare (or know how) to communicate our deeper selves to others. The human animal witnessed in its essence, with honesty and without artifice, with all its longings, crazed desires and despair, is always gripping. When we dismiss a person as boring, we are merely pointing to someone who has not had the courage or concentration to tell us what it is like to be them. But we invariably prove compelling when we succeed in detailing some of what we crave, envy, regret, mourn and dream. The interesting person isn’t someone to whom obviously and outwardly interesting things have happened, someone who has travelled the world, met important dignitaries or been present at critical geopolitical events. Nor is it someone who speaks in learned terms about the great themes of culture, history or science. They are someone who has grown into an attentive, self-aware listener and a reliable correspondent of their own mind and heart, and who can thereby give us faithful accounts of the pathos, drama and strangeness of being them.

Women want to ‘want’ their men. Women want a Man who other men want to be, and other women want to fuck. She doesn’t want a slave to her intimacy since this puts her in the masculine role. Rather, she wants a decisive mature man who has the confidence to put her off, to tell her ‘No’, in favor of his ambition and passions as this serves two purposes. First, it sets his frame and his direction as the one of authority, and his development as the primary; the results of which she and her potential children will benefit from. Secondly, it puts her into a position of chasing after him – essentially his legitimate ambitions and passions become the ‘other woman’ with which she must compete for his attention.

Married men, who were defeated before they committed, don’t think that elements of Game apply to marriage out of fear of upsetting their wives frame, when in fact being cocky & funny, neg hits and many other aspects of Game work wonderfully. Just kicking her in the ass or busting her chops, playfully, is sometimes enough to send the message that you’re fearless of her response.

As I’ve covered before, women fundamentally lack the capacity to appreciate the sacrifices men make to facilitate women’s reality – and once those facial wrinkles and cellulite can no longer be disguised by makeup or collagen, women will still persist in the expectation of monogamous obligation, in preference to the genuine desire, love, devotion, etc. a man may legitimately feel about her regardless of her wrinkles.

When Smith wonders why people are unwilling to do things that are morally reprehensible, he invokes the impartial spectator—the idea that we’re held in check by the judgments of an objective observer. Here, in talking about happiness, Smith invokes actual spectators, those in our social circle and beyond, who actually judge us. He’s saying that when that jury of our peers loves us for what we do and who we are, we’re happy.

He’s saying that we want to be seen as having integrity, honesty, good principles. We want to earn respect, praise, attention, and our good name—our good reputation—honestly. We want to be worthy of love. We want the love of others to be authentic in the sense that we don’t receive it on the cheap. Smith is saying that we care about our reputation—how others view us—and we care that we come by that reputation honestly, that it mirrors who we truly are.

He encourages us to face ourselves honestly. But perhaps the biggest challenge we face isn’t detecting false praise from others. Our biggest challenge comes from ourselves. We so much want to be lovely that we can convince ourselves of our loveliness when the reality is otherwise. The wise man may reject the praise he does not deserve. But it’s so hard to be wise. And it’s our own praise that’s hardest to reject.

So before hitting the next set of balls, I asked Joan, “This time I want you to focus your mind on the seams of the ball. Don’t think about making contact. In fact, don’t try to hit the ball at all. Just let your racket contact the ball where it wants to, and we’ll see what happens.” Joan looked more relaxed, and proceeded to hit nine out of ten balls dead center! Only the last ball caught the frame. I asked her if she was aware of what was going through her mind as she swung at the last ball. “Sure,” she replied with a lilt in her voice, “I was thinking I might make a tennis player after all.” She was right.

Experimental physics—hell, all of science—is about solving problems. However, you can’t solve them all at once. There’s always a larger, overarching question—the big target. But if you obsess on the sheer enormity of it, you lose focus. The key is to start small. Focus on solving problems you can answer. Build some dry ground to stand on. And after you’ve put in the work, and if you’re lucky, the mystery of the overarching question becomes knowable.

Three men in a car are driving down a city street early one morning. For the sake of analogy, suppose that each man represents a different kind of tennis player. The man sitting on the right is a positive thinker who believes that his game is great and is full of self-esteem because his tennis is so superior. He’s also a self-admitted playboy who enjoys all “the pleasures” life has to offer. The man sitting in the middle is a negative thinker who is constantly analyzing what is wrong with himself and the world. He is always involved in some kind of self-improvement program. The third man, who is driving, is in the process of letting go of judgmental thinking altogether. He plays the Inner Game, enjoying things as they are and doing what seems sensible. The car pulls up at a stoplight, and crossing the street in front of the car is a beautiful young lady who catches the attention of all three men. Her beauty is particularly apparent as she is stark naked! The man on the right becomes engrossed in thoughts of how nice it would be to be with this lady under other circumstances. His mind races through past memories and future fantasies of sensual pleasures. The man sitting in the middle is seeing an example of modern decadence. He’s not sure that he should be looking closely at the girl. First miniskirts, he thinks, then topless dancers, then bottomless dancers, and now they’re out on the streets in broad daylight! Something must be done to stop all this! The driver is seeing the same girl that the others are observing, but is simply watching what is before his eyes. He sees neither good nor bad, and as a result, a detail comes to his attention which was not noticed by either of his companions: the girl’s eyes are shut. He realizes that the lady is sleepwalking. Responding immediately with common sense, he asks the person next to him to take the wheel, steps out of the car, and puts his overcoat over the woman’s shoulders. He gently wakes her and explains to her that she must have been sleepwalking and offers to take her home. My friend Bill used to end the story with a twinkle in his eye, saying, “There he received the rewards of his action,” leaving each listener to hear what he would.

THE THESIS OF THE LAST CHAPTER WAS THAT THE FIRST STEP IN bringing a greater harmony between ego-mind and body—that is, between Self 1 and Self 2—was to let go of self-judgment. Only when Self 1 stops sitting in judgment over Self 2 and its actions can he become aware of who and what Self 2 is and appreciate the processes by which it works. As this step occurs, trust is developed, and eventually the basic but elusive ingredient for all top performance emerges—self-confidence.

What does “Trust thyself” mean on the tennis court? It doesn’t mean positive thinking—for example, expecting that you are going to hit an ace on every serve. Trusting your body in tennis means letting your body hit the ball. The key word is let. You trust in the competence of your body and its brain, and you let it swing the racket. Self 1 stays out of it. But though this is very simple, it does not mean that it is easy.

Why shouldn’t a beginning player treat his backhand as a loving mother would her child? The trick is not to identify with the backhand. If you view an erratic backhand as a reflection of who you are, you will be upset. But you are not your backhand any more than a parent is his child. If a mother identifies with every fall of her child and takes personal pride in its every success, her self-image will be as unstable as her child’s balance. She finds stability when she realizes that she is not her child, and watches it with love and interest—but as a separate being.

My work in my late twenties involved a box much like this one. Only it was a one-inch cube designed to put a macroscopic object into superposition. Into what we physicists sometimes call, in what passes for humor among scientists, cat state. As in Schrödinger’s cat, the famous thought experiment. Imagine a cat, a vial of poison, and a radioactive source in a sealed box. If an internal sensor registers radioactivity, like an atom decaying, the vial is broken, releasing a poison that kills the cat. The atom has an equal chance of decaying or not decaying. It’s an ingenious way of linking an outcome in the classical world, our world, to a quantum-level event.

My work in my late twenties involved a box much like this one. Only it was a one-inch cube designed to put a macroscopic object into superposition. Into what we physicists sometimes call, in what passes for humor among scientists, cat state. As in Schrödinger’s cat, the famous thought experiment. Imagine a cat, a vial of poison, and a radioactive source in a sealed box. If an internal sensor registers radioactivity, like an atom decaying, the vial is broken, releasing a poison that kills the cat. The atom has an equal chance of decaying or not decaying. It’s an ingenious way of linking an outcome in the classical world, our world, to a quantum-level event. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics suggests a crazy thing: before the box is opened, before observation occurs, the atom exists in superposition—an undetermined state of both decaying and not decaying. Which means, in turn, that the cat is both alive and dead.

Is there another world, just as real as the one we know, where we opened the box and found a purring, living cat instead? The Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics says yes. That when we open the box, there’s a branch. One universe where we discover a dead cat. One where we discover a live one. And it’s the act of our observing the cat that kills it—or lets it live. And then it gets mind-fuckingly weird. Because those kinds of observations happen all the time. So if the world really splits whenever something is observed, that means there’s an unimaginably massive, infinite number of universes—a multiverse—where everything that can happen will happen.

The more you learn about cognition, the more you realize that our perception of the world isn't even reliable. And it doesn't stop with the senses – we have other cognitive blind spots as well. Our memories are faulty – we can actually “remember” things that never happened, but feel like they did. We recall emotional events differently than mundane ones. Our confidence in our memory has little or nothing to do with the accuracy of our recollections. It's all a bit unsettling.

For example, at night a girl may ask, “What do you do?” even though she isn’t really interested. It’s just a default question she asks to size you up and to pass the time until she gets rid of you for the next guy. But during the day, that same question is a huge indicator of interest and almost guarantees you’ll get her phone number.

I’m not saying lower your standards during the day, but understand that she’ll jump up a full point when you get her out on a date.

Some days, I feel my sanity slipping. Amanda once said that her old world had begun to feel like a ghost, and I think I know what she means. We associate reality with the tangible—everything we can experience with our senses. And though I keep telling myself there’s a box on the South Side of Chicago that can take me to a world where I have everything I want and need, I no longer believe that place exists. My reality—more and more every day—is this world. Where I have nothing. Where I’m a homeless, filthy creature whose existence evokes only compassion, pity, and disgust. Nearby, another homeless man is standing in the middle of the sidewalk, having a full-volume conversation with nobody. I think, Am I so different? Aren’t we both lost in worlds that, for reasons beyond our control, no longer align with our identity?

How do you beat an opponent who is inherently wired to predict any and all moves you might make? You do something completely random. Unplanned. You make a move you haven’t considered, to which you’ve given little or no prior thought. Maybe it’s a bad move that blows up in your face and costs you the game. But perhaps it’s a play the other you never saw coming, which gives you an unanticipated strategic advantage. So how do I apply that line of thinking to my situation?

In another, I decided that becoming a father in my late twenties wasn’t the path for me. I worried my work would be lost, that my ambition would die. “So there’s a version of our life where we didn’t keep the baby. Charlie. You pursued your art. I pursued my science.

And somewhere along the way, he realized everything he’d given up by letting his work be the thing that defined him. He looked back at the choice he made fifteen years ago with regret. But the box can’t take you back or forward in time. It only connects all possible worlds at the same moment, in the present. So he searched until he found my world. And he traded my life for his.”

The correct way to handle a woman who is suffering from a temporary low sex drive is to gently reframe it as something negative about her without hurting her self-esteem. For example, if a woman tells you that she is not in the mood, say “Uh oh, I think I’m wearing my baby out…don’t worry about it though, it’s OK if you need a break for a little while.” This type of reframe gives her motivation to improve her sex drive without putting pressure on her.

Over time, it’s been more profitable to invest in small companies than in large companies. The successful small companies of today will become the Wal-Marts, Home Depots, and Microsofts of tomorrow. It’s no wonder then that funds that invest in small companies (the so-called small caps) have beaten out the “large cap” funds by a substantial margin. (“Cap” is short for “market capitalization”—the total number of shares issued by a company multiplied by the current share price.) A couple of Wal-Marts is all they need to outperform the competition. That one stock is up more than two-hundred-and-fifty-fold in twenty years. Since small-cap stocks are generally more volatile than large-cap stocks, a small-cap fund will give you more extreme ups and downs than other types of funds. But if you have a strong stomach and can take the bumps and stay on the ride, you’ll likely do better in small caps.

These warnings are printed in large red letters so people can’t say they didn’t see them. On Wall Street, the warning labels are called “red herrings.”

In any event, once an offering is completed, the proceeds are divided. A small chunk of the money goes to the underwriters—the investment banks that organized the road show and put together the deal. Another chunk goes to the founders of the company, plus the angels and the venture capitalists, who use the offering to sell some of their shares. The rest of the money is returned to the company itself. This is the capital it uses to expand the business.

Young and Taylor were testing a tool for communication. But they had accidentally discovered a tool for detection. The two engineers repeated the experiment successfully several more times, and a few days later, on September 27, they sent a letter to their superiors describing a new way to detect enemy ships. A line of US ships carrying receivers and transmitters could immediately detect “the passage of an enemy vessel … irrespective of fog, darkness or smoke screen.” This was the earliest known proposal for the use of radar in battle. One military historian would later write that the technology changed the face of warfare “more than any single development since the airplane.”

It is the 1960s, somewhere in Germany. Among the staff of a German administration office is the son of a brewer. His name is Niklas Luhmann. He went to law school, but he has chosen to be a public servant, as he did not like the idea of having to work for multiple clients. Fully aware he is also not suited for a career in administration, as it involves a lot of socializing, he excuses himself every day after his 9-5 shift and goes home to do what he liked most: reading and following his diverse interests in philosophy, organizational theory and sociology.

In Germany, a professor traditionally starts with a public lecture presenting his or her projects, and Luhmann, too, was asked what his main research project will be. His answer would become famous. He laconically stated: “My project: theory of society. Duration: 30 years. Costs: zero” (Luhmann, 1997, 11). In sociology, a “theory of society” is the mother of all projects.

Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box.

In a second step, shortly after, he would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing. He then would turn to the main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box. He kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a single sheet, but would sometimes add another note to extend a thought.

He usually wrote his notes with an eye towards already existing notes in the slip-box. And while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote them with great care, not much different from his style in the final manuscript: in full sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew his material. More often than not, a new note would directly follow up on another note and would become part of a longer chain of notes. He then would add references to notes somewhere else in the slip-box, some of them which were located nearby, others in completely different areas and contexts.

Whenever he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make possible connections between them. Adding a note directly behind another note is only one way of doing this. Another way is by adding a link on this and/or the other note, which could be anywhere in the system. This very much resembles, of course, the way we use hyperlinks on the internet. But, as I will explain later, they are quite different and it would be rather misleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database on paper.

What they’re always hoping for is the warm climate, also known as the Goldilocks climate, when everything is just right. But it’s hard to maintain the Goldilocks climate.

In the Zettelkasten, keywords can easily be added to a note like tags and will then show up in the index. They should be chosen carefully and sparsely. Luhmann would add the number of one or two (rarely more) notes next to a keyword in the index (Schmidt 2013, 171). The reason he was so economical with notes per keyword and why we too should be very selective lies in the way the slip-box is used. Because it should not be used as an archive, where we just take out what we put in, but as a system to think with, the references between the notes are much more important than the references from the index to a single note.

Many students and academic writers think like the early ship owners when it comes to note-taking. They handle their ideas and findings in the way it makes immediate sense: If they read an interesting sentence, they underline it. If they have a comment to make, they write it into the margins. If they have an idea, they write it into their notebook, and if an article seems important enough, they make the effort and write an excerpt. Working like this will leave you with a lot of different notes in many different places. Writing, then, means to rely heavily on your brain to remember where and when these notes were written down.

They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either in the reference system or, written as if for print, in the slip-box. 3.    Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished.

The only permanently stored notes are the literature notes in the reference system and the main notes in the slip-box. The former can be very brief as the context is clearly the text they refer to. The latter need be written with more care and details as they need to be self-explanatory.

In contrast to the fleeting notes, every permanent note for the slip-box is elaborated enough to have the potential to become part of or inspire a final written piece, but that can not be decided on up front as their relevance depends on future thinking and developments. The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference.

Taking smart notes is the precondition to break with the linear order. There is one reliable sign if you managed to structure your workflow according to the fact that writing is not a linear process, but a circular one: the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about.

If your first chosen topic turns out to be not as interesting, you will just move on and your notes will cluster around something else. Maybe you will even note down the reasons why the first question is not interesting and turn that into an insight valuable enough to make public.

But if we feel constantly stuck in our work, we will become demotivated and much more likely to procrastinate, leaving us with fewer positive or even bad experiences like missed deadlines. We might end up in a vicious circle of failure (cf. Fishbach, Eyal and Finkelstein, 2010). Any attempts to trick ourselves into work with external rewards (like doing something nice after finishing a chapter) are only short-term solutions with no prospect of establishing a positive feedback loop. These are very fragile motivational constructions. Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can the dynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel the whole process forward (DePasque and Tricomi, 2015).

Michelle Segar uses this dynamic to turn even the most stubborn coach potatoes into exercise aficionados (Segar, 2015). She brings those who really don’t like exercise but know they have to do it into a sustainable workout routine by focusing on one thing: Creating satisfying, repeatable experiences with sports. It doesn’t matter what her clients are doing – running, walking, team sports, gym workouts or bicycling to work. The only thing that matters is that they discover something that gives them a good experience that they would like to have again. Once her clients find something, they are encouraged enough to try something else as well. They enter the virtuous circle where willpower isn’t needed anymore because they feel like doing it anyway. If they tried to trick themselves into exercise by rewarding themselves afterwards with a relaxed evening on the sofa watching TV, it wouldn’t have taken them long until they went straight for the sofa, skipping the workout altogether, because this is how we tick.

Dweck shows convincingly that the most reliable predictor for long-term success is having a “growth mindset.” To actively seek and welcome feedback, be it positive or negative, is one of the most important factors for success (and happiness) in the long run.

The slip-box is not a collection of notes. Working with it is less about retrieving specific notes and more about being pointed to relevant facts and generating insight by letting ideas mingle. Its usability grows with its size, not just linearly but exponentially. When we turn to the slip-box, its inner connectedness will not just provide us with isolated facts, but with lines of developed thoughts. Moreover, because of its inner complexity, a search thought the slip-box will confront us with related notes we did not look for. This is a very significant difference that becomes more and more relevant over time. The more content it contains, the more connections it can provide, and the easier it becomes to add new entries in a smart way and receive useful suggestions.

Psychologists used to think of the brain as a limited storage space that slowly fills up and makes it more difficult to learn late in life. But we know today that the more connected information we already have, the easier it is to learn, because new information can dock to that information. Yes, our ability to learn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age. But if facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hang together in a network of ideas, or “latticework of mental models” (Munger, 1994), it becomes easier to make sense of new information.

Zeigarnik successfully reproduced what is now known as the Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory – until they are done. That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance. But thanks to Zeigarnik’s follow-up research, we also know that we don’t actually have to finish tasks to convince our brains to stop thinking about them. All we have to do is to write them down in a way that convinces us that it will be taken care of. That’s right: The brain doesn't distinguish between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note. By writing something down, we literally get it out of our heads. This is why David Allen’s “Getting things done” system works: The secret to have a “mind like water” is to get all the little stuff out of our short-term memory. And as we can’t take care of everything once and for all right now, the only way to do that is to have a reliable external system in place where we can keep all our nagging thoughts about the many things that need to be done and trust that they will not be lost.

The first step is to break down the amorphous task of “writing” into smaller pieces of different tasks that can be finished in one go. The second step is to make sure we always write down the outcome of our thinking, including possible connections to further inquiries. As the outcome of each task is written down and possible connections become visible, it is easy to pick up the work any time where we left it without having to keep it in mind all the time. [22] Possible subsequent tasks are open questions or connections to other notes, which we could elaborate on further or not. It also comes up in explicit reminders like “review this chapter and check for redundancies,” which belong into the project folder. Or the third option is the simple fact that something is still in our in-box waiting to be turned into a permanent note – a quick and not-yet–crossed-out note in our notebook, or literature notes not yet archived in our reference system.

When we extract ideas from the specific context of a text, we deal with ideas that serve a specific purpose in a particular context, support a specific argument, are part of a theory that isn’t ours or written in a language we wouldn’t use. This is why we have to translate them into our own language to prepare them to be embedded into new contexts of our own thinking, the different context(s) within the slip-box. Translating means to give the truest possible account of the original work, using different words – it does not mean the freedom to make something fit. As well, the mere copying of quotes almost always changes their meaning by stripping them out of context, even though the words aren’t changed. This is a common beginner mistake, which can only lead to a patchwork of ideas, but never a coherent thought.

While the literature notes will be stored within the reference system together with the bibliographic details, separate from the slip-box, but still close to the context of the original text, they are already written with an eye towards the lines of thoughts within the slip-box. Luhmann describes this step as follows: “I always have a slip of paper at hand, on which I note down the ideas of certain pages. On the backside I write down the bibliographic details. After finishing the book I go through my notes and think how these notes might be relevant for already written notes in the slip-box. It means that I always read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box.”

The slip-box forces us to be selective in reading and note-taking, but the only criterion is the question of whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box. The only thing that matters is that it connects or is open to connections. Everything can contribute to the development of thoughts within the slip-box: an addition as well as a contradiction, the questioning of a seemingly obvious idea as well as the differentiation of an argument.

The slip-box is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed. It just prefers relevant notes. It is after reading and collecting relevant data, connecting thoughts and discussing how they fit together that it is time to draw conclusions and develop a linear structure for the argument.

One has to read extremely selectively and extract widespread and connected references. One has to be able to follow recurrences. But how to learn it if guidance is impossible? […] Probably the best method is to take notes – not excerpts, but condensed reformulated accounts of a text. Rewriting what was already written almost automatically trains one to shift the attention towards frames, patterns and categories in the observations, or the conditions/assumptions, which enable certain, but not other descriptions. It makes sense to always ask the question: What is not meant, what is excluded if a certain claim is made? If someone speaks of ‘human rights:’ What distinction is made? A distinction towards ‘non-human rights?’ ‘Human duties?’ Is it a cultural comparison or one with some historic people who didn’t have the concept of human rights, but lived okay together anyway? Often, the text does not give an answer or a clear answer to this question. But then one has to resort to one’s own imagination.” (Luhmann

It is very similar to what we do when we take smart notes and combine them with others, which is the opposite of mere re-viewing (Stein et al. 1984) Elaboration means nothing other than really thinking about the meaning of what we read, how it could inform different questions and topics and how it could be combined with other knowledge.

And she also stresses that it is no less important to do something with these ideas – to think hard about how they connect with other ideas from different contexts and could inform questions that are not already the questions of the author of the respective text.

without or can easily afford—can sail through a recession unscathed. Companies that sell big-ticket items such as cars, refrigerators, and houses have serious problems in recessions. They can lose millions, or even billions, of dollars, and unless they have enough money in the bank to tide them over, they face the prospect of going bankrupt. Many investors have learned to “recession-proof” their portfolios. They buy stocks only in McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, or Johnson & Johnson, and other such “consumer growth” companies that tend to do well in cold climates. They ignore the likes of General Motors, Reynolds Metals, or U.S. Home Corp. These are examples of “cyclical” companies that suffer in cold climates. Cyclical companies either sell expensive products, make parts for expensive products, or produce the raw materials used in expensive products. In recessions, consumers stop buying expensive products.

In fact, it’s the central banking system that controls the money supply. Whenever the economy is cooling off too much, the Fed does two things. It lowers the interest rates that banks must pay when they borrow money from the government. This causes the banks to lower the interest rates they charge to their customers, so people can afford to take out more loans and buy more cars and more houses. The economy begins to heat up. The Fed also pumps money directly into the banks, so they have more to lend. This pumping of money also causes interest rates to go down. And in certain situations, the government can spend more money and stimulate the economy the same way you do every time you spend money at a store.

If the economy is too hot, the Fed can take the opposite approach: raising interest rates and draining money from the banks. This causes the supply of money to shrink, and interest rates go higher. When this happens, bank loans become too expensive for many consumers, who stop buying cars and houses. The economy starts to cool off. Businesses lose business, workers lose their jobs, and store owners get lonely and slash prices to attract customers.

If IBM had been smart enough to demand some of the rights to MS-DOS, its shares would be selling for a much higher price. Instead, IBM let Microsoft retain all the rights, which is why Microsoft has become a billion-dollar company in its own right. The moral to this story is: If you are about to make somebody very rich, insist on a piece of the action.

The auto industry was the most obvious trouble spot. Before the 1960s, we were first in war, first in peace, and first in cars, and Detroit was the car lover’s Mecca. But after that, our auto companies got sloppy and let the factories run down. Through their powerful unions, the workers demanded higher and higher wages. At this point, the Japanese and the Germans attacked Detroit with their spiffy, well-made, low-priced cars. Millions of U.S. consumers preferred these foreign models to the humdrum, poorly made, overpriced American cars.

This wasn’t a one-year improvement, or five years, it was a gigantic long-term trend. Just as it took years for Detroit to lose its place at the top of the auto industry, it took years for the comeback. This comeback totally surprised a lot of people, but that’s because we weren’t getting the real story. We were hearing the old news, about how the auto industry was controlled by the Japanese. But it wasn’t the Japanese who invented the minivan; it was Chrysler. It wasn’t the Japanese who put a new generation of snazzy, low-cost automobiles on the road; it was Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors. It wasn’t Nissan that redesigned the Jeep; it was Chrysler. It wasn’t the Toyota that became the best-selling car in Europe, it was the Ford Fiesta.

Fred Smith didn’t start Federal Express, also known as FedEx, because he needed the money; Smith was already rich. He did it for the challenge, to create a mail system that works better than the post office. Because Smith succeeded, the post office has shaped up considerably.

This taught me not only that it’s difficult to predict markets, but also that small investors tend to be pessimistic and optimistic at precisely the wrong times, so it’s self-defeating to try to invest in good markets and get out of bad ones.

Improving Performance by Reducing Interference Most people try to improve their performance (P) by increasing their potential (p) through practicing and learning new skills. The Inner Game approach, on the other hand, is to reduce interference (i) at the same time that potential (p) is being trained—and the result is that our actual performance comes closer to our true potential.

would be unrealistic to hope we could go through life without them. But there is a technique we can use to minimize their impact on us. CHOOSING A FOCUS FOR OUR AWARENESS Here’s the strategy: by accepting distractions and then consciously choosing to focus our attention elsewhere, we can increase our awareness of the music—and lessen the amount of frustration we feel at the distractions. In order to really take advantage of everything that simple awareness can teach us, we need to leave our assumptions and ready-made judgments on one side and pay attention to what is actually going on. We can choose to put our attention where we want instead of leaving it on the distractions. What’s important here is that we should choose a focus for our awareness in the present moment, something happening right now—and not wander off into the past or future.

In order to really take advantage of everything that simple awareness can teach us, we need to leave our assumptions and ready-made judgments on one side and pay attention to what is actually going on. We can choose to put our attention where we want instead of leaving it on the distractions.

I also use the sense of sight to focus my awareness in the present moment while playing pieces that I have memorized: I close my eyes and visualize the score, reading it as if it were there on the stand in front of me. I can also imagine the patterns my fingers are making as I play, without looking at them.

Focusing on the sound of your playing or the music you are listening to will help to reduce Self 1 small talk, and make you less likely to be distracted by other sounds in the environment. It will also help to decrease any physical stress you may be feeling and to relax your muscles. It will bring your attention into the present and give you important feedback about how you are playing.

Many musicians find there is a big difference between the way they play when they are trying and when they are simply being aware. The awareness mode encourages the conscious mind to listen to what’s happening, and this increases the amount of feedback we receive, which allows positive changes to occur almost without effort.

Myron complained that he felt some tension in his back while he played the piano. His muscles were tight, and his playing reflected that tightness in a lack of flexibility. I made it clear to Myron that he shouldn’t judge himself critically, but simply be aware of his playing and be able to rate his tension on the one-to-ten scale. We agreed to rate his present level of tension as a five on the scale, with a one representing complete lack of tension and a ten representing maximum tension.

Dropping down to Gross Property Plant & Equipment, you notice the Less Accumulated Depreciation figure of $10,000. Barclay has “written off” $10,000 worth of machinery. He spent $50,000 to acquire this equipment, but now he’s carrying it on the books at a value of $40,000. He will get a $10,000 deduction on his taxes for this depreciation. Because of the kind of machinery he has, which is quickly outmoded, the IRS allows him to write off 20 percent of the value each year. The $10,000 is 20 percent of the $50,000 expenditure that showed up earlier under Gross Property Plant & Equipment.

When I worked with dancers, I discovered that although choreographers do have a written notation for the various moves they want the dancers to perform, the dancers themselves seldom work from it. The instructor or choreographer demonstrates a series of movements while the dancers watch. Then the dancers form a mental image of what they have seen and imagine their own bodies recreating the movements. Finally, when they have both seen the moves and “felt through them” in their bodies, they are able to execute the moves on the dance floor. Feeling the moves “in your body” allows you to rehearse them before you “go through the motions.” Recent findings suggest that this style of “kinesthetic” rehearsal actually programs and makes use of those parts of the nervous system that will be involved in physical execution.

During their car journey Nesterov didn’t mention the gash down Leo’s face. He spoke in short bursts about the town. Leo wasn’t listening, barely conscious of his surroundings, preoccupied with the question of what he’d just done. Had he tried to strangle his wife or was that some trick of his sleep-deprived brain? He touched the cut on his cheek, saw blood on his fingertip—it was true, he’d done it and he’d been capable of more. Another couple of seconds, a slight tightening of his grip, and she would’ve died. His provocation was that he’d given up everything: his parents, his career, all on a false pretext, the promise of a family, the notion that there was some tie between them. She’d tricked him, fixed the odds, skewering his decision. Only once she was safe and his parents were suffering did she admit the pregnancy was a lie. Then she went further, openly describing how she’d held him in contempt. She’d manipulated his sentimentality and then spat in his face. In exchange for his sacrifice, in exchange for overlooking incriminating evidence of her guilt, he’d gotten nothing. But Leo didn’t believe it for a second. The time of self-justification had ended. What he had done was unforgivable. And she was right to hold him in contempt. How many brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers had he arrested? How different was he from the man he considered his moral opposite—Vasili Nikitin? Was the difference merely that Vasili was senselessly cruel while he’d been idealistically cruel? One was an empty, indifferent cruelty while the other was a principled, pretentious cruelty which thought of itself as reasonable and necessary. But in real terms, in destructive terms, there was little to separate the two men. Had Leo lacked the imagination to realize what he was involved in? Or was it worse than that—had he chosen not to imagine it? He’d shut down those thoughts, brushed them aside.

The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein was an accomplished pianist and used to practice entire piano concerti without a keyboard to pass the time on long train journeys. When he hit a wrong note—without a keyboard—he would go back and correct it. Many musicians spend a great deal of their time practicing “away from their instruments” and find it to be musically effective, as well as offering them a chance to work on their music when they wouldn’t otherwise be able to. The body’s kinesthetic sense is an important part of musicianship. Dancing, singing, foot tapping, and “conducting along with the record” are other ways to engage the body with the music.

Aron hadn’t been told why he was sitting here or what unusual activity might possibly mean. As one of the youngest members of the department, only twenty years old, he wondered if this was some kind of initiation ritual—a test of loyalty, to see if he could follow orders. Obedience was valued more than anything else.

Leo understood that there was a perverse logic to the gang’s refusal to give them up. They were prepared to rape and murder for a small profit. But they were not prepared to snitch, to be a guard’s stool pigeon. It was a question of status. If the other urki, the members of their criminal fraternity, found out they were selling inmates for perks they would never be forgiven. They would probably be killed.

unpardonable error on our part. He was a Nazi agent. They sent him back with instructions to take revenge on us for our victory over the Fascists. That revenge has taken the form of these terrible attacks on our children; they targeted the very future of Communism. More than that, it was a propaganda campaign. They wanted our people to believe our society could produce such a monster when in fact he was corrupted and educated by the West, transformed by his time away from home and then returned with a poisoned, foreign heart. I notice that not one of these murders took place before the Great Patriotic War.

Sam tapped her hand on the steering wheel. Patrick held his hand outside the car and made air waves. And I just sat between them. After the song finished, I said something. “I feel infinite.” And Sam and Patrick looked at me like I said the greatest thing they ever heard. Because the song was that great and because we all really paid attention to it. Five minutes of a lifetime were truly spent, and we felt young in a good way. I have since bought the record, and I would tell you what it was, but truthfully, it’s not the same unless you’re driving to your first real party, and you’re sitting in the middle seat of a pickup with two nice people when it starts to rain.

Personally, I like to think my brother is having a college experience like they do in the movies. I don’t mean the big fraternity party kind of movie. More like the movie where the guy meets a smart girl who wears a lot of sweaters and drinks cocoa. They talk about books and issues and kiss in the rain. I think something like that would be very good for him, especially if the girl were unconventionally beautiful. They are the best kind of girls, I think. I personally find “super models” strange. I don’t know why this is.

If they don’t have energy or excitement about a topic, or they appear to switch topics spontaneously, then it’s clear that they aren’t interested in it. People won’t outright say that they want to talk about certain topics, so it’s up to you to pick up on their hints and react accordingly.

Here are some common breadcrumbs: The excitement, or lack thereof, in someone’s voice when you bring up a topic. If someone keeps trying to bring up a topic, this means they want to talk about it. If someone keeps looking away, this means that they are bored. If someone’s feet are pointed away from you, this means they want to stop talking to you. If you interrupted someone right as they were about to speak, ask them about it after you finish speaking to see what direction they were interested in going. See if you can tell if their smiles and laughs are fake or real, depending on how big they are and how quickly they fade or stop. If someone ignores what you say and goes back to what they were talking about before you spoke, they feel strongly about their point and want to expand on it. If someone leans their head on their hand, this means they might be bored with the current flow of the conversation. Look for how strongly someone nods in agreement with you, and on the flip side, how little excitement or emotion there is in their reaction.

One final thing: React to everything. This includes stories, gestures, looking at their phone, taking their jacket off, stretching their arms, questions about the same topic, a puzzled facial expression, tilting their head, an eye roll, an uncomfortable smile, and so on. There may not be a flashing emotion to demonstrate, but they still did these things for a reason, and if you react to everything, you will show yourself to be one hundred percent present with the other person.

Kierkegaard is a no-hugs-barred absolutist in his concept of unconditional love. He wrote, “Who is stronger? He who says, ‘If you do not love me, I will hate you,’ or he who says, ‘If you hate me, I will still continue to love you’?” We think we know the answer to that one. And so does our dog, God love him.

Exercise: The Awareness Inventory Taking an inventory of all the things you have going for you can help to restore your trust and confidence. By following the steps below, you can increase your awareness of the skills and abilities you already have: 1. Visual Awareness Recall how you look when you play with confidence. Allow yourself to run through your store of images that are evoked by the music. 2. Sound Awareness Remember how the music sounds when you are playing it well. Hear yourself playing it superbly in your head. 3. Feeling Awareness Recall the way your fingers or throat feels when you’re practicing. Remember the feelings that the music brings up in you and that you want to express. Be aware of the places in your body where tension sets in and how wonderful it feels to let that tension go. 4. Understanding Awareness Remember the time you have spent in preparing for this moment. Remember the learnings that you have been through and that your body now “knows.” Remember the many times when you have played the piece well.

Fifty years of removing foods containing these nutrients from our diets—foods like eggs, fresh cream, and liver—to replace them with low-fat or outright artificial chemicals—like trans-fat-rich margarine (trans-fat is an unnatural fat known to cause health problems)—has starved our genes of the chemical information on which they depend. Simply cutting eggs and sausage (originally made with lactic acid starter culture instead of nitrates, and containing chunks of white cartilage) from our breakfasts to replace them with cold cereals would mean that generations of children have been fed fewer fats, B vitamins, and collagenous proteins than required for optimal growth.

“Sweet potatoes are really nutritious!” without stopping to consider that some sweet potatoes—those grown in sterile, toxic soil—are nutritionally bereft. We can toss another package of farmed salmon into our shopping cart thinking that it’s essentially the same, nutritionally, as wild. And we can buy beef from cows raised on petrochemical-soaked corn, in deplorably crowded conditions, and tell ourselves that, as long as it’s tender, it’s every bit as good for us as the flesh from happy, roaming, grass-fed animals. Once they’ve got us believing such absurdities or, worse yet, buying our food reflexively as a thoughtless habit, they can get us to buy just about anything. Why, with a little marketing and the right package, they might even get us to eat dog food.

As I described earlier, whenever our ancestors moved from one place to another, their diets changed and, in turn, so did their physiologies. And, as you’ll recall, each time they relocated from one natural locale to another, though that relocation influenced their stature and relative prominence of certain facial features, their skeletons generally remained perfect examples of function and proportionality. They didn’t think of food in terms of carbs and protein and fat. They thought more in terms of good soil, healthy animal, freshly picked. And for this reason, their traditional cultural practices, and the foods they took into their bodies, kept them firmly tethered to the natural world. In other words, they stayed connected.

Like THC in marijuana, the sugar in fruit and sugarcane entices humans and other animals to spread the plant’s DNA. But this relationship is taken to dangerous extremes as refined sugar commands us to reorder the surface of the planet; millions of acres of tropical rainforest are burned every year to sustain the ongoing habit of a growing population. We work for corn, too. Each step in the production of high-fructose corn syrup is a giant leap forward in corn’s domination of the planet. Sugar-producing plants like corn, cane, beets, berries, and mangos give us a legal high every bit as addictive as a hit of crack cocaine, though less intoxicating. What I am arguing, however, is that sugar’s hold on us is more dangerous than any illegal substance because its effects are subtler and more pervasive.

Life is full of stresses and trials. Normally, we deal with them and move on. But studies like this suggest that when we offer kids sweet treats as an incentive to settle down, we’re rewiring their brains, potentially preventing them from learning normal, healthy, and more socially appropriate coping strategies than screaming for a box of juice. I have spoken with several child psychologists who feel that discipline among children is fast on the decline. For whatever reason, more and more adults seem unable to control their kids. My feeling is that if you start loading kids with sugar as a way of controlling behavior, you are not only training them to rely on external chemicals to feel good, you are training them to manipulate you to provide them with their fix. Sorry, Willy Wonka, but my patients who’ve taken their kids off sugar tell me they can’t believe what a better, more balanced, healthier family life they now have.

Dieters are typically encouraged to choose low-fat based on the idea that each spoonful of a low-fat product, say yogurt or a mocha cappuccino, will have fewer calories. This fails to consider the fact that manufacturers make low-fat taste more palatable by adding sugar.

Foods like bread, pasta, potatoes, and rice are little more than containers for sugar. A seven-ounce serving of cooked spaghetti is converted into the amount of sugar contained in four twelve-ounce cans of Pepsi. Unlike Pepsi, the pasta has been fortified with iron and a few vitamins. The starchy parts of plants also carry small amounts of protein and minerals, but white flour and white rice have had most of that removed. Whether the rice and bread are white or brown, whether the starch is in the form of breakfast cereal or tortilla chips, pasta or pancakes, complex or simple, you’re mostly eating sugar.

flavor and nutrient-rich ingredients can dominate the composition. I am not a big fan of breaking foods into carbs, protein, and all that. But because starchy, empty-calorie foods fill so many shelves in the store, it’s one category we have to be aware of. I advise my patients with diabetes, or those who want to lose weight, to keep their total average carbohydrate intake under 100 grams per day. That allows for one small bowl of pasta, or four pieces of bread, or two apples, and that’s it. Fruit Sugar Another big source of sugar that surprises many people is sweet, sugary fruit. We’ve heard time and again we should “eat fruits and vegetables,” as though the two are equivalent. But they’re not. Vegetables contain a higher nutrient-to-energy ratio than fruit. Even fruits with decent nutrient content—like wild blueberries—are full of sugar. When you eat citrus, you’re getting a wallop of sugar with very little nutrient thrown in. That’s

That’s why, for most people, eating one apple-sized portion of fruit per day is plenty. With all that sugar, fruit just doesn’t make the grade as a health food. As I tell my patients, fruit is a more natural alternative to a candy bar. And fruit juice, which lacks fiber and many of the antioxidants, is little better than soda.

So how much heat is too much heat? If, when you slice it, there’s not even a trickle of juice, it’s way overdone. Steak should be juicy and red. I recommend you work your way down to medium rare, and once you get used to that, go for rare. One last thought: if you’re an Anthony Bourdain fan, you already know that restaurant patrons who order their steak well done get the oldest, least choice cuts. It’s not that the chefs have it in for people who order their steaks brown; they have to save the freshest product for those palates that can taste the difference.

Organic animal products give you more bang for your buck because they benefit from bioconcentration. Concentration refers to the percent of a substance present in something. Bioconcentration is a process that results in a living organism having a higher concentration of a substance than its surrounding media. Bioconcentration is usually used in reference to pollutants. When you spray plants with herbicides and pesticides, some gets taken up into their tissues. When animals eat these plants, they also eat the pesticides and herbicides. The majority of these chemicals are fat-soluble and will accumulate in fat. Since vegetables are naturally low in fat, when you buy organic vegetables, you are only avoiding a little bit of poison. When you buy organic meat, especially the fatty cuts, you’re avoiding a lot.

HOW THE FOUR PILLARS WILL MAKE YOU HEALTHIER Whatever your age, whatever illnesses run in your family, whatever your “risk factors,” however many times you’ve tried to lose weight or build muscle, eating the foods I’ve described in this chapter will transform your body. And if you are planning a baby, eating Four Pillar foods before, during, and after conception, and then feeding them to your child as he or she grows up, will allow the genes in his or her body to express in ways yours may not have. Meat on the bone will bring enough of the glycosaminoglycan growth factors and bone-building minerals to make a child’s joints strong and their bones tough, enabling them to grow tall and excel in sports. In adulthood, these same factors will keep your joints well-lubricated and prevent aging bones from crumbling. No combination of supplements has the right balance of bioavailable minerals and collagen-derived growth factors to fortify your body as effectively as meat on the bone. Organ meats bring the vitamins and brain-building fats that can ensure children will have mental stability and an aptitude for learning, and continued consumption of these foods is the best way to guarantee that your brain cells and nerves stay healthy for the rest of your life. Because these nutrients deteriorate so rapidly, no pills can effectively encapsulate them. Fermented foods, full of probiotics, protect the intestinal tract from invading pathogens. Since a healthier intestine is more able to take in nutrients, probiotics may prevent infections and allergic disorders from developing elsewhere in the body, reducing the need for repeated doses of antibiotics. Probiotics living in our intestine also produce all sorts of vitamins, which help to round out a diet that might otherwise be deficient. Sprouted foods enable you to enjoy your breads and breakfast porridges without consuming the empty calories that cause obesity and diabetes. And finally, fresh foods are naturally loaded with more antioxidants than can possibly survive the processes of drying, overcooking, or being stuffed into a capsule and bottled. This is just a brief look at the benefits imparted by the Four Pillars. People who aren’t connected to any culinary tradition don’t consume any of the Four Pillars as often as they should. If you build your diet on the foundation of the Four Pillars, and get regular exercise and plenty of sleep, you will immediately notice vast improvements in how you feel. Those differences will compound over the years to keep you looking young.

This level of workout demands your concentration. Yoga instructors call it mindfulness. Weight lifters who argue for the benefits of free weights over universal machines believe they get faster results when they have to concentrate on things like balancing a heavy barbell above their chests. The more aware we are of the act of exercising, the more we engage our muscles. Concentration level influences how nerve and muscle cells respond, so whether for an intense run or just walking up the stairs, you’ll see more results if you focus on every motion—the swinging of your arms, your calves lifting your spine, your hip rotation. If you’re running, focus on really filling your lungs. If going up the stairs at work, focus on working the calves for one flight, then try to engage the butt muscles the next. Focus on the contra-body motion—different parts of your body rhythmically moving in opposing directions. Dancing, swimming, golf—each involves contra-body motion, which helps you to involve the whole body. Mindfulness of motion applies to all forms of exercise and is a prerequisite to improving performance.

Three Habits of Successful Exercisers 1. Mindfulness. Use your body consciously. The best exercises involve the entire body. I don’t care if you are thumb wrestling; think about your stance, your balance, your breathing, and you’ll fake-twitch faster, grab harder, jive better, and bring the opposing thumb to its knees. Never forget that exercise should be fun. Don’t allow yourself to do anything that causes a pinch or a dull ache. Listen to your body. If it’s objecting, take time off or change what you’re doing. Keep in mind that exercise builds more than just muscle, it builds practically all functional tissues; it increases their investment with nerve endings and blood vessels, builds bone, strengthens ligaments, and so much more. Many exercise physiologists firmly believe that conscious intention during and after exercise—visualizing what you are doing and what you hope to accomplish—is key to getting the most from a workout. 2. Time management. Aerobic exercise takes time. The more time you give it, the more it gives you. (Up to a point. A reasonable cap is an average of thirty to forty minutes per day.) Want to detox? Aerobic exercise cleanses your system of inflammatory debris. If you’re new to exercise, start with ten minutes a day and increase by 10 percent each week. And don’t forget to get plenty of sleep. If your bed’s uncomfortable, get another one. And nice pillows and sheets—it’s all money well spent. It’s mostly during sleep that our bodies heal and rebuild tissue, so sleep is crucial. 3. Push yourself. Anaerobic exercise demands more concentration than aerobic exercise. If your doctor says you’re healthy enough for intensive exercise, then you should get to the point where you feel a burn and then keep going for another minute or two. Do that ten times per week and you will see improvement. Make sure you can distinguish a healthy anaerobic burn from the pain of an overstressed muscle. Keep in mind, even an aerobic workout can include elements of anaerobic strain, which helps you build healthy tissues faster.

Eating homemade bone stock in childhood has fantastic joint-strengthening and collagen-fortifying effects that can last a lifetime. The benefits are so dramatic that it’s astounding to me that more people haven’t noticed the connection. My patients who eat traditional cuisine with meaty stocks and rich bone broths on a regular basis tend to enjoy all the hallmarks of well-built bones and connective tissue—no matter their age. They have broad hands with wide knuckles and relatively large feet that are proportionately wide from toe to heel. Their skin is smoother, with tighter pores and smaller hair follicle openings, reflecting greater tensile strength.

If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, "What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?" Instead, they demand: "How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?" Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.

For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures...

MASLOW'S CHARACTERISTICS OF SELF-ACTUALIZING PEOPLE A. PRIORITY OF VALUES LIKE TRUTH, LOVE, AND HAPPINESS 1. Acceptance of self, of others, of nature--"not complaining about water because it is wet." Stoic style of calmly accepting even the worst. (How? See Chapters 4, 5) 2. Identification with the human species--identification with all of humanity versus just their own family, friends, culture, or nation. (How? See Chapters 3, 4) 3. Emphasis on higher level values--see METAVALUE section on next page. 4. Perception of reality--greater perceptual accuracy of reality. Superior ability to reason and perceive the truth and understand people at a deeper level. 5. Discrimination between means and ends, between good and evil--Clearer and more focused upon ends than most people; though they view their experiences and activities more as ends in themselves than most people. (How? See Chapters 2, 3) 6. Resolution of dichotomies (conflicts). Resolved conflicts that plague most people, because of their highly developed, accepting philosophy of life. (How? See Chapter 3) B. INTERNALLY CONTROLLED 7. Autonomy and resistance to enculturation. (How? See Chapter 6) 8. Detachment and desire for privacy--high enjoyment of privacy and solitude. Calm and at peace with themselves. (How? See Chapters 5, 6, 8) 9. Spontaneity, simplicity, naturalness--reflects integration of values and habits. Open, integrated values and habits. (How? See Chapters 3, 6) C. HIGH INVOLVEMENT, PRODUCTIVITY, AND HAPPINESS 10. Problem-centering--easily forget self and easily absorbed in tasks they love and/or feel are extremely important. (How? See Chapters 3, 8) 11. Creativeness--retain an almost childlike fresh, naive, and direct way of looking at life. May be partly a result of other factors such as problem-centering. 12. Freshness of appreciation and richness of emotional reactions--ability to intensely focus on the present and highly involved in it. Very accepting of emotions. (How? See Chapters 7, 8) 13. High frequency of peak experiences. (How? See Chapters 7, 8) D. HIGH QUALITY INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS 14. (Intimate) Interpersonal relations--"deeper and more profound interpersonal relations than any other adults.” However, these very close relationships are often limited to a very few people. They tend to be kind, patient, affectionate, friendly, and unpretentious; but can be direct and assertive when needed. 15. Democratic character structure--a person's status is unimportant to them. They do respond to differences in values and character. (How? See Chapter 3) 16. Philosophical, unhostile sense of humor.

Focusing on satisfying these values (instead of focusing on lower values or negatives) is an important factor in why self-actualizing people are happier, more peaceful, and more productive than other people. They routinely meet their lower values (or have met them in the past), so now they are free to concentrate on these higher values.

When we make other people (or their approval) our ultimate concern, then we make them our "gods." We give them control of our lives and our happiness. Instead, take back the control of your life--take responsibility for your own happiness. Seek your own approval--not theirs. Let them have primary responsibility for their own happiness. Don't let them manipulate you with "guilt trips." (See internal control Chapter 6.)

Externally-centered (EC) values. EC values are more dependent upon conditions outside you for their fulfillment; they are more dependent upon other people or external forces. EC values include having money, success, achievement, and material or other possessions and include being loved, accepted, or respected by others.

Note the difference between loving others and wanting to be loved by others—the first is an IC value and the second an EC value. Giving in general is an IC value and receiving in general is an EC value. The IC-EC difference is the a secret sense in which it is better to give than to receive. Caring more about (or focusing on) what you do versus what is done to you increases your control and happiness. Other Eexamples include are happiness, love, integrity, honesty, learning, and excellence

. You can love someone a great deal, but keep that relationship in perspective by making other IC values your highest values. Then if they leave you, you can still find happiness through satisfaction of IC values such as growth, beauty, and loving others. No one can ever take away love of God, nature, music, sports, learning, or many other primarily mental activities. Another problem of over-valuing others is that fear of losing them can undermine your relationships.

There is a difference between my definition of personal power and society's definition of power. Society often measures power by criteria such as accomplishment, money, status, influence, or fame. By society’s definition of power, Adolf Hitler was one of the most powerful men in history. He did have a huge impact on history.

For years Allen had led a life in which he seemed to give happiness for self and others top priority. He took time to lead a fulfilling life--balanced across many life areas. He took the time needed to "smell the roses" in each activity he participated in. Allen was successful in his career, but had not emphasized his career as much as the most successful in his field had. He was usually in a good mood and was giving toward other people. He would sometimes give even when he could not afford to. Yet he loved people and loved to give--he gave out of a desire to give and the joy it gave him. This lifestyle worked well for years. Then Allen became involved with someone who was very ambitious for financial success. He began to feel a great deal of external and internal pressure to be more successful, make more money, and build a small empire of possessions. His mood changed dramatically during this period. He became dissatisfied with his work, his relationship, and his life. He did make a lot more money and was even more successful in his business in the short run. Yet, he got tired of the rat race and constantly fantasized about escaping. Finally, Allen realized that he had let the means to happiness become the end. Despite his love for her, he ended the relationship because it had become unhealthy and unhappy. He put happiness back on track ahead of success and money, and once again was a happy (but wiser) man.

prisoners could not tolerate this environment and died. Dr. Frankl wrote that the key survival factor was the will to live, and that whenever someone lost that will, he would die shortly thereafter. Many "ran into the wire" of the electric fence to end their misery. Others became ill. Some simply became immobilized in a catatonic state until they died. Dr. Frankl kept both his life and his humanity. His survival secret was to create his own positive inner world. He created a fantasy life with his wife and spent many hours in their imaginary life together outside the camp. Listen to the words of a man who overcame one of history’s most inhumane situations.
  The salvation of man is through love and in love.

still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. . .

To change our feelings from negative to positive, we need to first recognize, understand, and accept the negative feeling. That is step one. Step two is to find out what is behind the feeling and then try to find ways of changing those feelings. Simply pretending that we do not feel what we feel is not usually adequate to overcome the negative feelings.

In addition, a belief that our emotions are out of control contributes to anxiety and depression. We can stop undermining our self-esteem and self-confidence by monitoring our language. We can stop using "helplessness" language and start using "choice" language. Choice language is based on underlying beliefs such as the following. • "I can make choices that determine how I feel." •  "We are responsible for our own emotions." •  "I can be honest with myself and others I trust."

Seeking happiness is partly choosing to find interesting things to do, but it is mostly a mental skill--learning how to make every activity as interesting and fun as it can be. The more we begin to look for creative ways of generating interest and enjoying ourselves in difficult or unpleasant situations, the more skilled we become.

The story of this client illustrates an important lesson. Whenever we allow ourselves to believe that a certain person, object, career, home, lifestyle, or anything is the only route to happiness, then that belief alone will undermine our happiness. This belief in exclusivity makes us much more dependent upon that one route. Then, any threat to that one route will profoundly threaten our happiness--because we believe that that one route is our only route to happiness.

For example, I talk to many college students who keep taking classes and avoid facing a choice about what career they want. One client became a senior before he really got serious about researching and choosing a major. Then, he decided to major in business. If he had chosen business as a freshman, he would have been able to graduate in four years. However, choosing it as a senior meant that it would still take him three more years to graduate--the cost of not facing his anxiety.

One thing that both Freud and Maslow (and most psychologists) agreed about was that self-knowledge is a key to mental health. The process of self-exploration is a prerequisite to maximizing happiness and personal power.  From our point of view, Freud's greatest discovery is that the great cause 
of much psychological illness is the fear of knowledge of oneself--
of one's emotions, impulses, memories, capacities, potentialities, of one's destiny.  (Abraham Maslow, Toward a Psychology of Being, 1960, p. 57) Fear of the inner monster--most of us fear looking too far inside.

I classify all unpleasant or negative emotions as either some form of anxiety, depression, or anger. (See harmonious functioning chapter for more explanation.) Anxiety includes subcategories of fear, guilt, stress, confusion, nervousness. Anger includes resentment, irritation, frustration, and rage. Depression includes boredom, loneliness, apathy, (some) tiredness, sadness, and grief.

(7) Keep asking yourself, "What am I MOST afraid of?" Another version of that question is, "What is the WORST thing that can happen?" These questions can help you unlock mysteries that may have haunted you for years. Our underlying fears drive much of our anxiety, depression, and anger. Discovering, facing, and overcoming our worst fears will solve most problems! I have seen many clients with underlying fears that have been the root of their unhappiness for years. When they finally face these fears, their lives are often transformed--at least in that one area. It is sad that they had been living at less than their potential for so many years--when confronting these fears could have set them free. Is this happening to you in some important life area now? In the short-run, facing your greatest fears may take time and be painful; however, in the long-run, avoiding them, covering them up, rationalizing them, or blaming others produces far more pain.

we spend all our resources for pleasure now, we may not have any left for pleasure tomorrow. Freud contrasted the pleasure principle with the reality principle. The reality principle understands that to maximize pleasure over a longer period of time, it is often wise to undergo some pain in the short run. Many college students sacrifice their time and endure poverty in order to have a happier career and life later. We are all familiar with these ideas. So is our cognitive system. Most philosophers and religions view the ability to delay gratification (when wise) as an important way that we can increase our overall happiness for self and others.

The executive self is president of one’s life and personality. The executive self (like part of Freud's ego) is a cognitive system that is in charge of our personality and life. Our executive self makes important decisions and plans. It resolves conflicts between lower centers. Why is it that some people's executive allows them to weigh more than 300 pounds, take drugs, abuse others, or have other serious psychological problems?

The reason is because we believe that higher, more comprehensive rules are more important than that specific rule. The reason that mortgage companies assess penalties is because otherwise it would cost them interest income if a person were very late with his payment. However, John's payment was only 18 cents short. So being a few days late giving them the additional 18 cents would not really cost them any significant amount of interest. A higher, more comprehensive rule states, "If no harm, then no penalty."

Honesty brings harmony and integration to the cognitive system. We can temporarily trick ourselves into denying what some inner part of us knows to be true, but we can never totally escape that honest part of ourselves. It will be somewhere inside causing conflict and anxiety for the part that is living a lie. The alcoholic, foodaholic, or workaholic may keep denying that they have a problem, but some healthier part of their cognitive system knows that they are lying to themselves. It will not be totally repressed. It will keep creating guilt and anxiety until it is heard. If we make truth a top-priority conscious value, then we are aligning the higher (cognitive) parts of ourselves with our basic biological nature that seeks truth. Hunger and thirst for honesty and openness! Doing otherwise will develop a self that is torn into warring parts--like members of a dysfunctional family. Seeking honesty will help develop a self that is integrated and spontaneous--like members of a loving, happy family. If we are honest with ourselves, our life-affirming and happiness-affirming beliefs eventually triumph; because they really work better!

In a letter to Dawn, Sherry sent sand from Seal Beach and suggested that she listen to the song Hero. Dawn wrote back. She loved the sand, and had--almost unbelievably--an encounter with Bernie Siegel, who had been kind and helpful. Coincidentally, she had already been listening to the song, Hero, during all her chemotherapy sessions. The song Hero is a reminder that you may feel all alone in the world and feel no one is there for you. Yet, you can always feel loved if you look deep enough inside to your Higher Self. Inside is a hero that always loves you, is always there for you, and is strong enough to overcome any circumstances. At times, you may feel weak, empty, and hopeless. However, if you look to your Higher Self, you will find the strength to survive and the strength to rise above your fears. For inside your heart, you will find your inner hero. Dawn, indeed, found the hero inside herself. Think of your Higher Self as your Inner Hero whenever you need strength or love you can’t find from others, or don't think you have yourself.

He never had enough success to prove that he was a "minimally ok human being.” Consequently, he never believed that anyone--including his wife--could really love him exactly as he was right then. He thought he had to buy her love or show her that he was more successful than other men.

Learning to love and accept our "most unacceptable" parts. My wife, Sherry, tried following Wayne's suggestion from his book and found that she could accept every part of her body except her tummy. She has felt most of her life that her middle was too big. She always wished that she could have a tiny waistline. For years, she had chosen clothes partly because they hid her tummy. She consciously worked on looking at her tummy, developing positive thoughts about it, and loving her tummy instead of disowning it. Her attentiveness worked: she felt better about her tummy and accepted it. This new tummy-acceptance had a number of effects. She bought and wore clothes that allowed her tummy to be seen. She started tucking in her blouses and wearing dresses with belts. Previously, if I were being affectionate, she would not allow me to even touch her tummy. Now I could love her tummy too. The most interesting thing is that her tummy began to get smaller!

Limiting versus expanding self-beliefs. An alternative to having such limiting self-beliefs is to see ourselves as having almost limitless potential. It is not that we don't really have limits, but that we do not allow ourselves to retain ideas that limit us. That means that we do not allow ourselves to say to ourselves that we are too limited in any way--unless we have absolute proof! We are not too old, too young, too dumb, too weak, too slow, too disabled, too sick, too emotional, too shy, too afraid of . . ., too poor, or any other "too." Instead, we can develop a positive view of ourselves that says we believe in our own strengths--especially our abilities to learn and to motivate ourselves to do what will make us happy.

For example, a gang member may want to be seen as a “bad ass.” When someone else says he’s “badder,” then the only choice is to fight or be publicly humiliated. The fear of public humiliation and loss of self-esteem seems to be worse than violence or the fear of death.

One problem I have is that my thirst for truth and knowledge can have a “dark side” if I develop the additional belief that I know more than others. If I spend a lot of time learning about something, I am tempted to conclude that I know more about it than other people. In someone else’s view, I’m just a “know it all.” Or--even worse--if I let myself believe that I “should” know more than anyone else about it, then I develop a fragile self-belief that is easily threatened by anyone challenging my knowledge. Whenever I allow myself to get too proud of myself in some knowledge area, then I become defensive and argumentative in that knowledge area.

They can accept their own human nature in the stoic style, with all its shortcomings, with all its discrepancies from the ideal image without feeling real concern. It would convey the wrong impression to say that they are self-satisfied. What we must say rather is that they can take the frailties and sins, weaknesses, and evils of human nature in the same unquestioning spirit with which one accepts the characteristics of nature. One does not complain about water because it is wet or about rocks because they are hard, or about trees because they are green. As the child looks out upon the world with wide, uncritical, undemanding, innocent eyes, simply noting and observing what is the case, without either arguing the matter or demanding that it be otherwise, so does the self-actualizing person tend to look upon human nature in himself and in others.

Self-confidence is at the root of self-fulfilling prophesies. Another research finding is called the self-fulfilling prophesy. An example of a positive self-fulfilling prophesy would be if you believe, "Lori will probably like me if I talk with her.” That belief alone can partially cause you to initiate a conversation with Lori and be friendlier to her. Thus, the belief alone actually increased the probability that it would be fulfilled (since the belief actually helped cause the action that helped cause the prophecy's fulfillment.)

OUR SELF-CONCEPT AFFECTS OUR SELF-CONFIDENCE Our general beliefs about ourselves can have a powerful effect upon our self-confidence across many situations. An engineering student in his mid-twenties came to one of my workshops because he was a junior on academic probation (had less than a "C" grade average). He really wanted to be an engineer, but he believed that he was not as smart as the other students. As a result he usually felt insecure in his classes or in any situation that related to engineering. He was afraid to talk to his instructors because he feared they would discover his secret--that he was really "dumb." Whenever he came across a difficult problem or idea, he would give up easily because he thought that he was "too dumb" to ever understand it. His underlying false belief was, "If I feel confused, it must be because I'm dumb." He often felt confused, so that "proved" he was "dumb.” What he didn't know is that the "A" students often feel confused also, because the ideas and problems really are hard. Feeling confused is not an indication of intelligence or ability; it is a normal part of the learning process. (See Chapter 7 on harmonious functioning and peak performance). How is this an example of a negative self-fulfilling prophesy? The belief he was "dumb" caused him to give up too soon. If he had believed he had the ability to solve the problem, he would have persisted.

OUR SELF-CONCEPT AFFECTS OUR SELF-CONFIDENCE Our general beliefs about ourselves can have a powerful effect upon our self-confidence across many situations. An engineering student in his mid-twenties came to one of my workshops because he was a junior on academic probation (had less than a "C" grade average). He really wanted to be an engineer, but he believed that he was not as smart as the other students. As a result he usually felt insecure in his classes or in any situation that related to engineering. He was afraid to talk to his instructors because he feared they would discover his secret--that he was really "dumb."

If he had believed he had the ability to solve the problem, he would have persisted.
  We can believe that we are too strong and secure to feel threatened. Several weeks later, this student came in for counseling. He told me that the workshop helped him reinterpret his confusion. He no longer assumed that he was dumb. Each time he started to assume that he was "dumber" than the other engineering students; he questioned that assumption and persisted until he understood or solved the problem. His effort, understanding, and grades improve dramatically. In addition, he enjoyed his classes more and felt more confident about his intelligence in general. He said, "I used to think that the few students who could solve the tough homework problems must be brilliant. Now, I am one of them--I can't believe it." His increased self-confidence in his personal intellectual power gives him more confidence in almost any problem-solving situation--even outside of engineering. It is important to note that his intelligence had not increased--only his belief in himself. It was not important that he believe he was brilliant, it was only important that he believe he

Self-esteem is like a mountain stream that begins with a small spring and ends in a mighty river. The small spring begins in our Higher Self with empathy for our own and other's feelings. Empathy forms a basis for unconditional self-love and unconditional love of others. Empathy and love are constant sources of positive thoughts and feelings. Unconditional self-worth is not dependent upon who we are, what we do, what we have, or what anyone thinks about us. If we have self-worth, then self-confidence is a bonus. Self-confidence is based upon our belief that we have the right motivation, knowledge, and skills to reach our goals. The best kind of self-confidence is knowing that we have the basic motivation and ability to learn in any situation. What began as empathy and unconditional self-love forms the basis for self-confidence in all areas of life. That self-caring and self-confidence provides the power of a mighty river for overcoming life's logjams.

These fears may have originated from other people's comments (parents, peers, or authorities). These negative comments may have some element of truth, but our critics may exaggerate the negative aspect. In the process they may teach us their negative cognitive bias styles (overgeneralization, exaggerations, selective abstraction, or negative bias). Thus, we may learn to exaggerate our own deficiencies whenever we make any kind of mistake or anyone criticizes us.

What if you are afraid to accept some awful truth about yourself? Another possible reason that you might seek approval so much is that you do not accept some truth about yourself. Maybe your fear of this awful truth causes you to be more externally controlled. There are two general solutions to a problem--fix it or accept it. The philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr initiated the famous serenity prayer, 
  God, give me the power to change that which I can change, the power to accept that which I cannot change, and the wisdom to know the difference. If we love ourselves unconditionally, we can accept any truth about ourselves. The first step in 12-step programs for people addicted to alcohol or drugs is to privately and publicly accept the truth that they are alcoholic.

TRYING TO BE POPULAR versus TAKING GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF AND THOSE YOU LOVE One of the sad things about trying to get everyone to like us is that we can end up hurting those we care most for. We may take our own needs and the needs of those we love most for granted, while we are spending our energy trying to please those for whom we care less (and who care less for us). The more internally directed person has little need for being popular. Maslow's self-actualized people were often famous leaders, but the goal of being popular was unimportant to them. They were much more concerned about their own happiness and goals for making the world a better place. They usually only had a small number of close friends, and other people's opinions of them mattered relatively little.

If you are in a manipulative or codependent relationship, strong disapproval may mean that you are confronting core aspects of your partner's dysfunctional beliefs.

REPLACE AVOIDANCE, EXCUSES, AND "SHOULDS" WITH CHOICES Avoidance Behavior--avoiding negative consequences--is one of the primary reinforcers of allowing external control. Letting others make decisions and take responsibility for a situation may be easier than facing the situation and taking responsibility for it ourselves. The situations we are avoiding could be rejection, conflict, being alone, work, being wrong, failing, being criticized, or any situation which leads to unhappy emotions such as guilt, anxiety, or boredom.

You don't need to call yourself “lazy” or to hide your real motives from yourself. It is much more productive to explore why you honestly don't want to do something. Understanding why you don't want to do it gives you a stronger sense of self-control than believing that "I can't motivate myself."

You don't need to call yourself “lazy” or to hide your real motives from yourself. It is much more productive to explore why you honestly don't want to do something. Understanding why you don't want to do it gives you a stronger sense of self-control than believing that "I can't motivate myself." After self-exploration, if you still don't want to do it, then you can assertively state, "I choose not to do it." Inside, you will feel more self-control, because you will understand your real motives for making the choice. Outside, people may get upset; but they will eventually respect and trust you more. No more excuses!

Internal control focus means primarily focusing on our own desires, feelings, goals, plans, and thoughts. An assertive stance is to be sensitive to both your own and the other's values, but normally (1) giving some preference to your own values and (2) attempting to achieve win-win outcomes (so both are happy). Use your Higher Self's genuine empathy and love of self and others as a guide.

Many external forces try to influence our decisions-- including many people we love and respect. Many internal forces try to influence our decisions-- including many lower and higher desires. If we are too influenced by external forces, we risk lack of inner satisfaction and depression. If we are too influenced by our own self-directed desires, we risk social consequences and guilt. Allowing the Higher Self to balance empathetic listening to both internal with external messages, and to give primary responsibility for meeting desires to each individual can resolve the internal--external control conflict. We can attain internal control and win-win solutions.

These harmonious experiences may be similar to what Maslow referred to as "peak experiences." He found that self-actualizing people--especially those who focused more on mental activities--tended to have many more peak experiences than most people. He characterized these peak experiences as a feeling of inner harmony and oneness with themselves and the universe.

The optimal state of experience is one 
in which there is order in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy--or attention--is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action. The pursuit of the goal brings order in awareness because a person must concentrate attention on the task at hand and 
momentarily forget everything else. These periods of struggling to overcome challenges are what people 
find to be the most enjoyable times in their lives . . . By stretching skills, by reaching toward higher challenges, 
such a person becomes an increasingly extraordinary individual. . . . "Flow" is the way people describe their state of mind when consciousness is harmoniously ordered, and they want to pursue what they are doing for its own sake.

We feel the impulses of the higher self when we are drawn out of ourselves, wanting to connect more deeply with others, to absorb our minds in our work, to think instead of react, to follow our own path in life, and to discover what makes us unique. The lower is the more animal and reactive side of our nature, and one that we easily slip into. The higher is the more truly human side of our nature, the side that makes us thoughtful and self-aware. Because the higher impulse is weaker, connecting to it requires effort and insight.

In fact, stress or tension can reveal flaws in people that they have carefully concealed from view. It is often wise to observe people in such moments, precisely as a way to judge their true character. Whenever you notice rising pressure and stress levels in your life, you must watch yourself carefully. Monitor any signs of unusual brittleness or sensitivity, sudden suspicions, fears disproportionate to the circumstances. Observe with as much detachment as possible, finding time and space to be alone. You need perspective. Never imagine that you are someone who can withstand rising stress without emotional leakage. It is not possible. But through self-awareness and reflection you can prevent yourself from making decisions you will come to regret.

There is an exhilarating, positive aspect to the stimulation of group emotions. It is how we can be rallied to do something for the collective good. But if you notice the appeal is to more diabolical emotions, such as hatred of the other, rabid patriotism, aggression, or sweeping worldviews, you need to inoculate yourself and see through the powerful pull as it works on you. It is often best to avoid the group setting if possible in order to maintain your reasoning powers, or to enter such moments with maximum skepticism.

For these purposes, it might be wise to use a journal in which you record your self-assessments with ruthless objectivity. Your greatest danger here is your ego and how it makes you unconsciously maintain illusions about yourself. These may be comforting in the moment, but in the long run they make you defensive and unable to learn or progress. Find a neutral position from which you can observe your actions, with a bit of detachment and even humor. Soon all of this will become second nature, and when the Emotional Self suddenly rears its head in some situation, you will see it as it happens and be able to step back and find that neutral position.

The phenomenologists’ leading thinker, Edmund Husserl, provided a rallying cry, ‘To the things themselves!’ It meant: don’t waste time on the interpretations that accrue upon things, and especially don’t waste time wondering whether the things are real. Just look at this that’s presenting itself to you, whatever this may be, and describe it as precisely as possible. Another phenomenologist, Martin Heidegger, added a different spin. Philosophers all through history have wasted their time on secondary questions, he said, while forgetting to ask the one that matters most, the question of Being. What is it for a thing to be? What does it mean to say that you yourself are? Until you ask this, he maintained, you will never get anywhere. Again, he recommended the phenomenological method: disregard intellectual clutter, pay attention to things and let them reveal themselves to you.

None of the old authorities can relieve you of the burden of freedom.

If this sounds difficult and unnerving, it’s because it is. Sartre does not deny that the need to keep making decisions brings constant anxiety. He heightens this anxiety by pointing out that what you do really matters. You should make your choices as though you were choosing on behalf of the whole of humanity, taking the entire burden of responsibility for how the human race behaves. If you avoid this responsibility by fooling yourself that you are the victim of circumstance or of someone else’s bad advice, you are failing to meet the demands of human life and choosing a fake existence, cut off from your own ‘authenticity’.

For Sartre and Beauvoir, their open relationship was more than a personal arrangement; it was a philosophical choice. They wanted to live their theory of freedom. The bourgeois model of marriage had no appeal for them, with its strict gender roles, its hushed-up infidelities, and its dedication to the accumulation of property and children. They had no children, they owned little, and they never even lived together, although they put their relationship before all others and met almost every day to work side by side.

Sartre’s experiences and quirks found their way even into his most serious philosophical treatises. This could make for strange results, given that his personal take on life ranged from bad mescaline flashbacks and a series of embarrassing situations with lovers and friends to bizarre obsessions with trees, viscous liquids, octopuses and crustaceans. But it all made sense according to the principle first announced by Raymond Aron that day in the Bec-de-Gaz: you can make philosophy out of this cocktail.

He applied the same argumentative attitude to the personnel of philosophical history. He disagreed, for example, with René Descartes, who had founded modern philosophy by stating Cogito ergo sum: I think, therefore I am. For Kierkegaard, Descartes had things back to front. In his own view, human existence comes first: it is the starting point for everything we do, not the result of a logical deduction. My existence is active: I live it and choose it, and this precedes any statement I can make about myself. Moreover, my existence is mine: it is personal. Descartes’ ‘I’ is generic: it could apply to anyone, but Kierkegaard’s ‘I’ is the ‘I’ of an argumentative, anguished misfit.

But that was sixteen years ago, at the time I’m writing, and since then freedom has come into the spotlight again. We find ourselves surveilled and managed to an extraordinary degree, farmed for our personal data, fed consumer goods but discouraged from speaking our minds or doing anything too disruptive in the world, and regularly reminded that racial, sexual, religious and ideological conflict are not closed cases at all. Perhaps we are ready to talk about freedom again — and talking about it politically also means talking about it in our personal lives.

Second-Order Thinking Almost everyone can anticipate the immediate results of their actions. This type of first-order thinking is easy and safe but it’s also a way to ensure you get the same results that everyone else gets. Second-order thinking is thinking farther ahead and thinking holistically. It requires us to not only consider our actions and their immediate consequences, but the subsequent effects of those actions as well. Failing to consider the second- and third-order effects can unleash disaster.

"In making investments, I have always believed that you must act with discipline whenever you see something you truly like. To explain this philosophy, Buffett/Munger like to use a baseball analogy that I find particularly illuminating, though I myself am not at all a baseball expert. Ted Williams is the only baseball player who had a .400 single-season hitting record in the last seven decades. In the Science of Hitting he explained his technique. He divided the strike zone into seventy-seven cells, each representing the size of a baseball. He would insist on swinging only at balls in his 'best' cells, even at the risk of striking out, because reaching for the 'worst' spots would seriously reduce his chances of success.

"All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there" is one of his favorite quips. In business as in life, Charlie gains enormous advantage by summarily eliminating the unpromising portions of "the chessboard," freeing his time and attention for the more productive regions. Charlie strives to reduce complex situations to their most basic, unemotional fundamentals. Yet, within this pursuit of rationality and simplicity, he is careful to avoid what he calls "physics envy," the common human craving to reduce enormously complex systems (such as those in economics) to one-size-fits-all Newtonian formulas. Instead, he faithfully honors Albert Einstein's admonition, "A scientific theory should be as simple as possible, but no simpler." Or in his own words, "What I'm against is being very confident and feeling that you know, for sure, that your particular action will do more good than harm. You're dealing with highly complex systems wherein everything is interacting with everything else."

Biographers have been hard on Beauvoir for what looks like a case of sordid ‘grooming’ as well as unprofessional conduct. It is hard to tell what motivated her, since she seemed indifferent to both women for much of the time. Perhaps the explanation lay in the tense, debilitating atmosphere of phony-war Paris, which led many people to odd behaviour.

Like Sartre in Nausea, he points out that mostly we don’t see the fundamental problem of life because we don’t stop to think about it. We get up, commute, work, eat, work, commute, sleep. But occasionally a breakdown occurs, a Chandos-like moment in which a beat is skipped and the question of purpose arises. At such moments, we experience ‘weariness tinged with amazement’, as we confront the most basic question of all: why exactly do we go on living?

The main influence on Camus here was not Heidegger but Kierkegaard, especially in the 1843 essay Fear and Trembling. This too used a story to illuminate the ‘absurd’: Kierkegaard chose the Bible tale in which God commands Abraham to sacrifice his beloved son Isaac rather than the more usual goat or sheep. Rather to God’s surprise, it seems, Abraham travels to the sacrifice site with Isaac, making no complaint. At the last moment, God lets him off, and Abraham and Isaac go home. What astounds Kierkegaard is neither the obedience nor the reprieve, but the way in which Abraham and Isaac seem able to return to the way things were before. They have been forced to depart entirely from the realm of ordinary humanity and fatherly protection, yet somehow Abraham is still confident in his love for his son. For Kierkegaard, the story shows that we must make this sort of impossible leap in order to continue with life after its flaws have been revealed. As he wrote, Abraham ‘resigned everything infinitely, and then took everything back on the strength of the absurd’. This was what Camus thought his modern readers needed to do, but in his case without any involvement of God. Here, too, one can see connections to life in Occupied France. Everything has been compromised, everything lost — yet there it all still seems to be. It is the sense that has gone. How do you live without sense? The answer offered by both Camus and Kierkegaard amounted to something like the motto in the British morale-boosting poster: Keep Calm and Carry On.

For Sartre, the awakened individual is neither Roquentin, fixating on objects in cafés and parks, nor Sisyphus, rolling a stone up the mountainside with the bogus cheerfulness of Tom Sawyer whitewashing a fence. It is a person who is engaged in doing something purposeful, in the full confidence that it means something. It is the person who is truly free.

Being and Nothingess shares something else with Being and Time: it is unfinished. Both works end by dangling the prospect of a second part which will complete the argument of the book. Heidegger promises to demonstrate his ultimate point: that the meaning of Being is Time. Sartre promises to provide a foundation for existentialist ethics. Neither keeps the promise. What we do get in Being and Nothingness is an extended examination of human freedom, precisely worked out on the basis of a simple vision. Sartre argues that freedom terrifies us, yet we cannot escape it, because we are it.

To realise the extent of my freedom is to be plunged into what both Heidegger and Kierkegaard called ‘anxiety’ — Angst or, in French, angoisse. This is not a fear of anything in particular, but a pervasive unease about oneself and one’s existence. Sartre borrows Kierkegaard’s image of dizziness: if I look over a cliff and feel vertigo, it tends to take the form of the sickening sensation that I might, compulsively and inexplicably, throw myself off the edge. The more freedom of movement I have, the worse this anxiety becomes.

Make it a point to try to read these over the next 18 months. In addition, Dinosaur Brains: Dealing with All Those Impossible People at Work [BR89] discusses the emotional baggage we all bring to the work environment.

First, given that you’re not sure what form change will take, you can always fall back on the ultimate “easy to change” path: try to make what you write replaceable. That way, whatever happens in the future, this chunk of code won’t be a roadblock. It seems extreme, but actually it’s what you should be doing all the time, anyway. It’s really just thinking about keeping code decoupled and cohesive.

Note the situation in your engineering day book: the choices you have, and some guesses about change. Leave a tag in the source. Then, later, when this code has to change, you’ll be able to look back and give yourself feedback. It might help the next time you reach a similar fork in the road.

Today the main source of wealth is knowledge. And whereas you can conquer oil fields through war, you cannot acquire knowledge that way. Hence as knowledge became the most important economic resource, the profitability of war declined and wars became increasingly restricted to those parts of the world – such as the Middle East and Central Africa – where the economies are still old-fashioned material-based economies.

Today we think about peace as the implausibility of war.

When today we say that there is peace between France and Germany, we mean that it is inconceivable under any foreseeable circumstances that war might break out between them.

Terrorists are like a fly that tries to destroy a china shop. The fly is so weak that it cannot budge even a single teacup. So it finds a bull, gets inside its ear and starts buzzing. The bull goes wild with fear and anger, and destroys the china shop. This is what happened in the Middle East in the last decade.

It’s important to note, however, that the American Declaration of Independence guaranteed the right to the pursuit of happiness, not the right to happiness itself. Crucially, Thomas Jefferson did not make the state responsible for its citizens’ happiness. Rather, he sought only to limit the power of the state. The idea was to reserve for individuals a private sphere of choice, free from state supervision. If I think I’ll be happier marrying John rather than Mary, living in San Francisco rather than Salt Lake City, and working as a bartender rather than a dairy farmer, then it’s my right to pursue happiness my way, and the state shouldn’t intervene even if I make the wrong choice.

When Epicurus defined happiness as the supreme good, he warned his disciples that it is hard work to be happy. Material achievements alone will not satisfy us for long. Indeed, the blind pursuit of money, fame and pleasure will only make us miserable. Epicurus recommended, for example, to eat and drink in moderation, and to curb one’s sexual appetites. In the long run, a deep friendship will make us more content than a frenzied orgy. Epicurus outlined an entire ethic of dos and don’ts to guide people along the treacherous path to happiness.

The second half of the twentieth century was a golden age for the USA. Victory in the Second World War, followed by an even more decisive victory in the Cold War, turned it into the leading global superpower. Between 1950 and 2000 American GDP grew from $2 trillion to $12 trillion. Real per capita income doubled. The newly invented contraceptive pill made sex freer than ever.

According to the life sciences, happiness and suffering are nothing but different balances of bodily sensations. We never react to events in the outside world, but only to sensations in our own bodies. Nobody suffers because she lost her job, because she got divorced or because the government went to war. The only thing that makes people miserable is unpleasant sensations in their own bodies. Losing one’s job can certainly trigger depression, but depression itself is a kind of unpleasant bodily sensation.

People drink alcohol to forget, they smoke pot to feel peaceful, they take cocaine and methamphetamines to be sharp and confident, whereas Ecstasy provides ecstatic sensations and LSD sends you to meet Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. What some people hope to get by studying, working or raising a family, others try to obtain far more easily through the right dosage of molecules. This is an existential threat to the social and economic order, which is why countries wage a stubborn, bloody and hopeless war on biochemical crime. The state hopes to regulate the biochemical pursuit of happiness, separating ‘bad’ manipulations from ‘good’ ones. The principle is clear: biochemical manipulations that strengthen political stability, social order and economic growth are allowed and even encouraged (e.g. those that calm hyperactive kids in school, or drive anxious soldiers forward into battle).

According to Buddha, we can train our minds to observe carefully how all sensations constantly arise and pass. When the mind learns to see our sensations for what they are – ephemeral and meaningless vibrations – we lose interest in pursuing them.

This may sound like science fiction, but it’s already a reality. Monkeys have recently learned to control bionic hands and feet disconnected from their bodies, through electrodes implanted in their brains. Paralysed patients are able to move bionic limbs or operate computers by the power of thought alone. If you wish, you can already remote-control electric devices in your house using an electric ‘mind-reading’ helmet. The helmet requires no brain implants. It functions by reading the electric signals passing through your scalp. If you want to turn on the light in the kitchen, you just wear the helmet, imagine some preprogrammed mental sign (e.g. imagine your right hand moving), and the switch turns on. You can buy such helmets online for a mere $400.

Yet even cyborg engineering is relatively conservative, inasmuch as it assumes that organic brains will go on being the command-and-control centres of life. A bolder approach dispenses with organic parts altogether, and hopes to engineer completely non-organic beings. Neural networks will be replaced by intelligent software, which could surf both the virtual and non-virtual worlds, free from the limitations of organic chemistry.

If you really understand the theory of evolution, you understand that there is no soul. This is a terrifying thought not only to devout Christians and Muslims, but also to many secular people who don’t hold any clear religious dogma, but nevertheless want to believe that each human possesses an eternal individual essence that remains unchanged throughout life, and can survive even death intact.

That’s why the theory of evolution cannot accept the idea of souls, at least if by ‘soul’ we mean something indivisible, immutable and potentially eternal. Such an entity cannot possibly result from a step-by-step evolution. Natural selection could produce a human eye, because the eye has parts. But the soul has no parts. If the Sapiens soul evolved step by step from the Erectus soul, what exactly were these steps? Is there some part of the soul that is more developed in Sapiens than in Erectus? But the soul has no parts.

Hence the existence of souls cannot be squared with the theory of evolution. Evolution means change, and is incapable of producing everlasting entities. From an evolutionary perspective, the closest thing we have to a human essence is our DNA, and the DNA molecule is the vehicle of mutation rather than the seat of eternity. This terrifies large numbers of people, who prefer to reject the theory of evolution rather than give up their souls.

This theory was upheld by the father of modern philosophy, René Descartes. In the seventeenth century Descartes maintained that only humans feel and crave, whereas all other animals are mindless automata, akin to a robot or a vending machine. When a man kicks a dog, the dog experiences nothing. The dog flinches and howls automatically, just like a humming vending machine that makes a cup of coffee without feeling or wanting anything.

There are historic roots to these issues since the computer preceded the Internet. In the early days of personal computers one could not send files from one computer to the other. You needed to save a file on a floppy disc, walk over to the person who needed the file, and copy the file onto their computer so they could use it. If that person was in another country, you would need to go to the post office and mail the floppy disc to them. The emergence of the Internet Protocol (IP) put an end to this, connecting all those stand-alone computers with a data transmission protocol that made the transfer of data faster, and slashed the transaction costs of information exchange.

Therefore, many of these Web2 platforms needed to find alternative ways to profit from the free services they provided, and this alternative was advertising. What followed was targeted advertizing based on user behavior and the commodification of private data. Business models have, therefore, developed around targeted advertising that builds on the data sets collected, which provide “state” for these platforms. As a result of this, users are paying for services with their private data.

It is fleeing from the self, it is a short escape of the agony of being a self, it is a short numbing of the senses against the pain and the pointlessness of life. The same escape, the same short numbing is what the driver of an ox-cart finds in the inn, drinking a few bowls of rice-wine or fermented coconut-milk. Then he won't feel his self any more, then he won't feel the pains of life any more, then he finds a short numbing of the senses.

A blockchain address, which is derived from the private key, represents a pseudonymous digital identity of the token owner. Tokens are noted to belong to a certain address in the public ledger. Only the owner of that address can request to send these tokens somewhere else. In order to prove their ownership to other participants of the network, token holders need to sign transactions with their private key. This form of identity management is purely based on mathematical functions, allowing other computers in the network to confirm the validity of a transaction without needing to know the actual person or his secret private key

Subsequently, he introduced the idea of decoupling the smart contract functionalities from the processing functionalities of the network and started the Ethereum project.

Furthermore, alternative distributed ledger systems have emerged with completely different types of consensus mechanisms, such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that do not require the creation of a chain of blocks anymore, and instead use alternative cryptoeconomic mechanisms to reach consensus. Examples of networks that use DAGs as a consensus mechanism are “IOTA,” “Byteball,” or “Nano.”

Early Proof-of-Stake proposals assumed that those who have more stake in the system have a natural incentive to act in a truthful manner when validating transactions and writing blocks. It was assumed that token holders would have a natural interest in the long-term success of the network; otherwise, their stake in the system would devalue if they were to contribute in an untruthful manner. It was furthermore assumed that the more tokens one owns, the more one has at stake if the network is attacked. Voting rights were therefore designed proportional to the amount of network tokens held. However, there is a problem in the original Proof-of-Stake mechanism: as opposed to Proof-of-Work, where mining is costly, and it is therefore not smart to waste your energy on a fork that won’t earn you any money, Proof-of-Stake does not require computationally intensive work to create a block. It is assumed that the validator has nothing to lose but a lot to win.

For all you know, the year might be 2216 and you are a bored teenager immersed inside a ‘virtual world’ game that simulates the primitive and exciting world of the early twenty-first century. Once you acknowledge the mere feasibility of this scenario, mathematics leads you to a very scary conclusion: since there is only one real world, whereas the number of potential virtual worlds is infinite, the probability that you happen to inhabit the sole real world is almost zero. None of our scientific breakthroughs has managed to overcome this notorious Problem of Other Minds. The best test that scholars have so far come up with is called the Turing Test, but it examines only social conventions. According to the Turing Test, in order to determine whether a computer has a mind, you should communicate simultaneously both with that computer and with a real person, without knowing which is which.

The tail is one-third of the spine, is used for balance, and also serves an important role in communication. The tail helps the cat balance on high, narrow places and assists in high speed directional changes. An upright tail when the cat is standing or walking lets you know he’s alert. It’s also the position used in greeting. A relaxed cat’s tail is horizontal or somewhat down. When your cat flicks his upright tail at you, it’s usually meant as a greeting. In most cases, the message he’s sending is “Hi, I’ve missed you. When’s dinner?” A lashing or thumping tail reflects arousal or irritation. If you’re petting your cat when this happens, it’s a very good idea to back off. When a cat is resting, an occasional twitching or sweeping motion of the tail is his way of saying he’s relaxed but still alert. A frightened cat will puff out the hairs on his tail (piloerection) so it looks more than twice its size. A tail in an inverted “U” shape indicates that the cat is fearful and potentially defensively aggressive. A subordinate cat will tuck his tail between his legs or around his body, trying to be as small and invisible as possible. Injury to your cat’s tail can result in a permanent loss of balance and create severe or fatal bladder problems.

A smart contract is a piece of software that is processed by a distributed ledger. It is a rights management tool that can formalize and execute agreements between untrusted participants over the Internet, and comes with inbuilt compliance and controlling. ~ Smart contracts can reduce the costs of formalization and enforcement of a simple agreement between two parties, the bylaws of an organization, or to create different types of tokens. ~ The term “smart contract” was first coined by Nick Szabo in 1996 and precedes the development of blockchain networks. It was still the early days of the Web when Szabo pointed out that the digital revolution would not only create new institutions but could also formalize economic and social relations. ~ Smart contract use cases range from simple to complex. The most complex form of a smart contract is a decentralized autonomous organization. Smart contracts can also be used to create tokens. ~ Smart contracts have the potential to disrupt many industries. Use cases can be found in banking, insurance, energy, e-government, telecommunication, music & film industry, fine art, mobility, education, and many more. ~ Oracles provide the external data necessary for the smart contract and trigger smart contract executions when predefined conditions are met. Oracles are services that find and verify real world occurrences and submit this information to a smart contract, automatically triggering state changes on the blockchain. The primary task of oracles is to provide these values to the smart contract in a secure and trusted manner. These data flows stem either from software (Big Data application) or hardware (Internet of Things).

How to Leash Train The right equipment comes first. You’ll need to purchase a lightweight leash. Don’t get a chain or a heavy leather leash—you’re not walking a rottweiler. The lighter the leash the better, because it’ll be more comfortable for both of you and it’ll take less time for your cat to get used to it. You’ll also need a cat harness rather than a regular collar. Your leashed cat will pull out of a collar. There are several types of harnesses on the market. I use the Come with Me Kitty harness by Premier with my cats and clients’ cats due to its safety and comfort for the cats. Make sure your cat’s vaccinations are up-to-date before exposing her to the outdoors. She’ll also need an identification tag just in case she escapes from you. If it’s flea season, be sure she’s protected (see Chapter 13). Start leash and harness training indoors for the first couple of weeks. The first time you put the harness on your cat just be casual about it, then give her a treat, feed her, or distract her with playtime. Mealtime usually works best. Leave the harness on for about five to fifteen minutes. Repeat the procedure before the next meal. If your cat is normally fed free-choice, use treats or playtime to divert her attention away from the harness. If your cat struggles too much as you try to put the harness on, don’t attempt to buckle it; just get the harness on her and then immediately distract her. As your cat gets more comfortable, put the harness on her for longer periods during the day and always provide a positive diversion should she begin to resist it. Don’t leave it on her when you’re not there to supervise because she could get herself all worked up. In week two, introduce the leash. Attach it to the harness but don’t tug on it. She has to get used to the idea of being connected to something. If the leash is light enough, let your kitty drag it behind her while you provide a distraction. Be careful that she doesn’t get the leash caught on anything. It’s best to do this step in one room where she won’t be able to run off and possibly get tangled in something. Once she’s comfortable with this new attachment, you’ll begin the next phase of training. Very important warning: don’t tug on the leash at this point or your mild mannered cat will turn into a thrashing, growling, fur-covered chain saw. The way to introduce her to walking on a leash is through positive reinforcement. Here’s where clicker training can work as well. Have a supply of treats in your pocket. If your cat responds better to wet food, hold a small container of canned food and feed the cat a tiny amount from a soft-tipped baby spoon. If you feel as if you need an extra arm in order to handle the leash, clicker, food, and spoon, tape an extension onto the spoon and then tape the clicker to the end. That way you can click and reward with one hand. You can also attach a trainer’s pack to your belt and put a small opened container of wet food in there. With the leash loosely in your hand, take a step out in front of your cat. Hold a treat out at her eye level. When she starts walking toward the treat, click the clicker and give her the treat. Take another step forward, holding another treat and repeat the process. You can also use a target stick: hold it out in front of her and then click-and-treat when she takes a step forward. Continue this until she becomes used to walking with you. Gradually introduce a slight tug as you step forward. Don’t pull or yank the leash. It should be a gentle tug that’s barely detectable. Remember to give her time to eat her treat; don’t expect her to stay in motion all the time. When your cat is comfortable with this exercise, you can pair the behavior with a cue such as “let’s walk.” Do your walking sessions around the interior of the house. Don’t attempt to go outdoors with your cat until she’s totally comfortable walking on a leash. She shouldn’t struggle when you slightly increase tension on it. Be prepared for this to take anywhere from one to three weeks.

The concept of an interactive toy is simple: pole, string, and a toy target dangling on the end. What I love about these toys is that you can make the toy move as prey naturally would. If you’re going to think like a cat, you have to understand how they react to prey. The problem with all of the cute little toys that are strewn about the house is that they’re essentially dead prey. In order to play with them, the cat must work as both prey and predator. She has to bat at the toy to make it move. Once it slides a little on the floor it dies again and remains lifeless unless the cat pushes it back into motion. An interactive toy lets you create the movement so the cat can just enjoy being a predator.

How to Use Interactive Toys First, imagine your living room or den is about to be transformed into a hunting ground. The sofa, chairs, and tables will now become trees, bushes, rocks, and other things that the cat can hide behind. If you have a big, open space, scatter some pillows, cushions, or even an open paper bag to provide additional cover for your little predator. A common mistake made by well-meaning owners is to play with their cat by dangling the toy in front of her. The cat bats at the toy repeatedly. She sits up and appears to almost box the toy. Although this play method may look amusing and seem as if she’s having fun, it isn’t a natural form of cat playing/hunting. Remember that playtime is supposed to be a make-believe hunt.

Movements going across your cat’s visual field are easier for her to see and movements going away from her strongly trigger her prey-drive. Movements coming toward her are confusing, more difficult to see, and potentially viewed as threatening. Guide the toy over to a hiding place and then entice your cat by letting it just peek out.

“There was nothing he feared more than to be thought weak.”) But the weak and vulnerable child within does not miraculously disappear. If its needs have never been met or dealt with, its presence sinks into the unconscious, into the shadows of the personality, waiting to come out in strange ways.

Depression and anxiety come from not being your complete self, from always playing a role. It requires great energy to keep this dark side at bay, but at times unpleasant behavior leaks out as a way to release the inner tension.

Look at great public figures such as Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill. They possessed the ability to examine their flaws and mistakes and laugh at themselves. They came across as authentically human, and this was the source of their charm.

This longing to commit a madness stays with us throughout our lives. Who has not, when standing with someone by an abyss or high up on a tower, had a sudden impulse to push the other over? And how is it that we hurt those we love although we know that remorse will follow? Our whole being is nothing but a fight against the dark forces within ourselves. To live is to war with trolls in heart and soul. To write is to sit in judgment on oneself. —Henrik Ibsen

But those people didn’t quit. They didn’t feel sorry for themselves. They didn’t delude themselves with fantasies about easy solutions. They focused on the one thing that mattered: applying themselves with gusto and creativity.

They start. Anywhere. Anyhow. They don’t care if the conditions are perfect or if they’re being slighted. Because they know that once they get started, if they can just get some momentum, they can make it work.

Keep in mind the following: People trying to make a show of their authority are easily deceived by the surrender tactic. Your outward sign of submission makes them feel important; satisfied that you respect them, they become easier targets for a later counterattack, or for the kind of indirect ridicule used by Brecht. Measuring your power over time, never sacrifice long-term maneuverability for the short-lived glories of martyrdom.

It is always our first instinct to react, to meet aggression with some other kind of aggression. But the next time someone pushes you and you find yourself starting to react, try this: Do not resist or fight back, but yield, turn the other cheek, bend. You will find that this often neutralizes their behavior—they expected, even wanted you to react with force and so they are caught off-guard and confounded by your lack of resistance. By yielding, you in fact control the situation, because your surrender is part of a larger plan to lull them into believing they have defeated you.

If you find yourself temporarily weakened, the surrender tactic is perfect for raising yourself up again—it disguises your ambition; it teaches you patience and self-control, key skills in the game; and it puts you in the best possible position for taking advantage of your oppressor’s sudden slide.

When power deserts you, it is best to ignore this Law’s reversal. Leave martyrdom alone: The pendulum will swing back your way eventually, and you should stay alive to see it.

It’s one thing to not be overwhelmed by obstacles, or discouraged or upset by them. This is something that few are able to do. But after you have controlled your emotions, and you can see objectively and stand steadily, the next step becomes possible: a mental flip, so you’re looking not at the obstacle but at the opportunity within it.

Was he born this way? No. This was learned behavior. And Rockefeller got this lesson in discipline somewhere. It began in that crisis of 1857 in what he called “the school of adversity and stress.” “Oh, how blessed young men are who have to struggle for a foundation and beginning in life,” he once said. “I shall never cease to be grateful for the three and half years of apprenticeship and the difficulties to be overcome, all along the way.”
